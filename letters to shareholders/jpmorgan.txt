Jamie Dimon,
Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Once again, I begin this annual letter to shareholders with a sense of pride about
our company and our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world. As I
look back on the last decade — a period of profound political and economic change
— it is remarkable how much we have accomplished, not only in terms of financial
performance but in our steadfast dedication to help clients, communities and
countries all around the world.
In 2018, we continued to accelerate investments in products, services and
technology. For example, for the first time in nearly a decade, we extended our
presence in several states with new Chase branches (we plan to open another 400
new branches in the next few years). In addition, we started a new digital investing
platform: You Invest; we launched our partnership with Amazon and Berkshire
Hathaway in healthcare; we broadened our commitment to create opportunities
for jobs and prosperity and reduce the wealth gap for black Americans with
Advancing Black Pathways (announced in February 2019); and we launched our 
1

AdvancingCities initiative to support job and wage growth in communities most
in need of capital. While it is too soon to assess the impact of these efforts, we’re
seeing terrific results so far.
2018 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record
revenue and net income, even without the impact of tax reform. We earned
$32.5 billion in net income on revenue1
 of $111.5 billion, reflecting strong underlying
performance across our businesses. Adjusting for the enactment of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act, we now have delivered record results in eight of the last nine years,
and we have confidence that we will continue to deliver in the future. Each line
of business grew revenue and net income for the year while continuing to make
significant investments in products, people and technology. We grew core loans
by 7%, increased deposits in total by 3% and generally grew market share across
our businesses, all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance
sheet. In total, we extended credit and raised capital of $2.5 trillion for businesses,
institutional clients and U.S. customers.
In last year’s letter, we emphasized how important a competitive global tax system
is for America. Over the last 20 years, as the world reduced its tax rates, America
did not. Our previous tax code was increasingly uncompetitive, overly complex, and
loaded with special interest provisions that created winners and losers. This drove
down capital investment in the United States, which reduced domestic productivity
and wage growth. The new tax code establishes a business tax rate that will
make the United States competitive around the world and frees U.S. companies
to bring back profits earned overseas. The cumulative effect of capital retained
and reinvested over many years in the United States will help cultivate strong
businesses and ultimately create jobs and increase wages.
For JPMorgan Chase, all things being equal (which they are not), the new lower
tax rates added $3.7 billion to net income. For the long term, we expect that
some or eventually most of that increase will be erased as companies compete
for customers on products, capabilities and prices. However, we did take this
opportunity in the short term to massively increase our investments in technology,
new branches and bankers, salaries (we now pay a minimum of $31,000 a year
for full time entry-level jobs in the United States), philanthropy and lending
(specifically in lower income neighborhoods).

As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the
value we have created for our shareholders. If our asset and liability values are
appropriate — and we believe they are — and if we can continue to deploy this
capital profitably, we think we can continue to exceed 15% return on tangible
equity for the next several years (and potentially at or above 17% in the near term),
assuming there is not a significant downturn. If we can earn these types of returns,
our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book
value. The chart on the bottom of the opposite page shows that tangible book value
“anchors” the stock price.
In the last five years, we have bought back almost $55 billion in stock or
approximately 660 million shares, which is nearly 20% of the company’s common
shares outstanding. In prior letters, I explained why buying back our stock at
tangible book value per share was a no-brainer. Seven years ago, we offered an
example of this: If we bought back a large block of stock at tangible book value,
earnings and tangible book value per share would be substantially higher just four
years later than without the buyback. While we prefer buying back our stock at
tangible book value, we think it makes sense to do so even at or above two times
tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the past. If we
buy back a big block of stock this year, we would expect (using analysts’ earnings

Tangible book value over time captures the company’s use of capital, balance sheet and profitability. In this chart, we are looking at
heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share;
it is an after-tax number that assumes all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500 Index), which is a
pre-tax number that includes reinvested dividends.

estimates) earnings per share in five years to be 2%–3% higher and tangible book
value to be virtually unchanged. We want to remind our shareholders that we much
prefer to use our capital to grow than to buy back stock. I discuss stock buybacks
later in this letter.
While we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in
the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the
years. This progress is a function of continual investments, in good and bad times,
to build our capabilities — our people, systems and products. These important
investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow
and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five years, 10 years or since
the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger (approximately 14 years ago), our stock
has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard
& Poor’s Financials Index. And this growth came during a time of unprecedented
challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and the extraordinarily difficult
legal, regulatory and political environment that followed.

JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds
and directly by individual investors. However, it is important to remember that
in almost all cases, the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities.
Well over 100 million people in the United States own stock, and a large
percentage of these individuals, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase
stock. Many of these people are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters,
retirees, or those saving for a home, school or retirement. Your management
team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we
have to perform for our shareholders.
In the first section of this letter, I try to give a comprehensive understanding of
how we run our company, including how we think about building shareholder
value for the long run. In that section, I highlight our strong belief that building
shareholder value can only be done in conjunction with taking care of employees,
customers and communities. This is completely different from the commentary
often expressed about the sweeping ills of naked capitalism and institutions only
caring about shareholder value.
In the second section of this letter, I comment on important forward-looking issues.
While we remain optimistic about the long-term growth of the United States and
the world, the near-term economic and political backdrop is increasingly complex
and fraught with risks — both known and unknown. And we face a future with less
overall confidence in virtually all institutions, from corporations to governments
to the media. The extremely volatile global markets in the fourth quarter of 2018
might be a harbinger of things to come — creating both risks for our company and
opportunities to serve our clients.
The third section of this letter is about public policy, specifically American public
policy, which is a major concern for our country and, therefore, our company.
Again, I try to give a comprehensive, multi-year overview of what I see as some of
our problems and suggest a few ways they can be addressed. One consistent theme
is completely clear: Businesses, governments and communities need to work as
partners, collaboratively and constructively, to analyze and solve problems and
help strengthen the economy for everyone’s benefit.
I. JPMorgan Chase Principles and Strategies
1. First and foremost, we look at our business from the point of view of the
customer.
2. We endeavor to be the best at anything and everything we do.
3. We will maintain a fortress balance sheet — and fortress financial principles.
4. We lift up our communities.
5. We take care of our employees.
6. We always strive to learn more about management and leadership.
7. We do not worry about some issues.
II. Comments on Current Critical Issues
1. We need to continue to restore trust in the strength of the U.S. banking system
and global systemically important financial institutions.
2. We have to remind ourselves that responsible banking is good and safe banking.
3. We believe in good regulation — both to help America grow and improve
financial stability.
4. We believe stock buybacks are an essential part of proper capital allocation
but secondary to long-term investing.
5. On the importance of the cloud and artificial intelligence, we are all in.
6. We remain devoted and diligent to protect privacy and stay cyber safe —
we will do what it takes.
7. We know there are risks on the horizon that will eventually demand
our attention.
8. We are prepared for — though we are not predicting — a recession.

III. Public Policy
1. The American Dream is alive — but fraying for many.
2. We must have a proper diagnosis of our problems — the issues are real
and serious — if we want to have the proper prescription that leads to
workable solutions.
3. All these issues are fixable, but that will happen only if we set aside partisan
politics and narrow self-interest — our country must come first.
4. Governments must be better and more effective — we cannot succeed without
their help. The rest of us could do a better job, too.
5. CEOs: Your country needs you!
6. America’s global role and engagement are indispensable.

In this section, I want to give the reader a comprehensive view of how we run the company.
We manage the company consistently with these principles in mind – and they have stood
the test of time. We also strive to satisfy, and even exceed, the requirements of our regulators and governments around the globe – and we think these principles are a critical
component of that.
1. First and foremost, we look at our business from the point of view of the customer.
I. JPMORGAN CHASE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
Customer needs are what gets our attention.
We believe that in a hyper-competitive world
(from competitors known and unknown), the
best strategy – both offensive and defensive
– is to give the customer more: something
better, faster or more efficiently. We are
always on a quest to improve our products
and services, and, for the most part, this is
done with enhancements in technology and
through the continual training of our people.
Most fundamental of all is doing the right
thing for our customers – in all cases.
We energetically drive organic growth.
We continue to drive good and healthy
organic growth (meaning good customers,
products and services they need and want
at fair and reasonable prices), and while
we are happy with our progress, we recognize that we won’t meet every goal we set
for ourselves and can always do better. In
past letters, we have identified many areas
of organic growth. Our achievements with
these initiatives are detailed in the CEO
letters in this Annual Report, but a few of
the critical strategies are highlighted in the
sidebar below.
ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR LINES OF BUSINESS
Consumer &
Community
Banking
• By 2022, we expect 93% of the U.S. population to be in our Chase footprint
as we expand our branch network to new markets with an integrated
physical and digital approach. In addition to entering the Washington, D.C.,
Philadelphia and Boston markets in 2018, we recently announced nine new
markets for 2019, including Charlotte, Minneapolis, Nashville and St. Louis.
• The onboarding experience for new customers is being simplified.
Customers can open a new deposit account digitally in three to five minutes,
functionality that added approximately 1.5 million new accounts since its
February 2018 launch; we’re expanding this functionality inside our
branches as well. We also recently announced Chase MyHome, our new
digitally enabled mortgage fulfillment process that prefills applications for
our existing customers. It’s 20% faster than our paper-based process,
allowing us to close a mortgage within three weeks. Our confidence in our
enhanced approach is reflected in our money-back guarantee.
11
• Customers recently began receiving personalized merchant offers and
discounts from ChaseOffersSM. This program ramped up rapidly, with
customers activating 25+ million offers across 7 million cards in the initiative’s
first three months. CreditJourneySM, with more than 15 million users enrolled,
has also been a tremendously successful way to engage customers through
access to credit score information and identity protection.
• And later this year, we’ll make it easier for our credit card customers to
borrow on their existing lines through two new products — My Chase PlanSM,
allowing customers to finance a specific purchase at a reasonable cost at
the point of sale; and My Chase LoanSM, letting customers borrow against
their unused credit limit and pay back their debt in fixed amounts at a
competitive rate. These products enable us to compete for the approximately
$250 billion in card loans that our existing customers have with competitors.
Corporate &
Investment Bank
• We have been #1 in investment banking for the past decade and finished
2018 with 8.7% of global wallet share, the industry’s best. Still, we believe
we can increase our share over time as we continue to add bankers
selectively and leverage technology to provide better data and insights
to our clients.
• Our Treasury Services business grew revenue by 13% last year. As we
further implement our wholesale payments model, which includes merchant
services, we will be able to deliver a unique value proposition to our clients.
We see opportunities in every customer segment from middle market and
small businesses to large corporate clients and their business outside of
the United States.
• We have consistently grown share in Markets — including in businesses
where the wallet has shrunk. We are prioritizing investments in products
and technology to stay ahead of our clients’ needs. As companies expand
their businesses and acquire assets — increasingly across borders — our
global expertise in hedging risks and protecting capital can be as important
to them as the actual acquisition.
• Our Securities Services business has transformed itself into an industry
powerhouse, and it sits alongside the world’s leading trading businesses. As
asset managers face ongoing pressures from passive investing and margin
compression in the coming years, we think we have a unique opportunity to
help them become more efficient by outsourcing support functions and
using our innovative technology platforms.
• Our Corporate & Investment Bank is one of the few truly global businesses
in the financial services industry. As emerging countries take their place on
the global stage, we will be there to support them. The investments we are
making in China and in other emerging markets today will result in our
international growth for years to come. 
12
Commercial
Banking
• Being able to deliver the broad-based capabilities of JPMorgan Chase at a
very local level is a key competitive advantage. Since launching our Middle
Market expansion efforts, we are now local in 39 new markets and have
added 2,800 clients, resulting in 22% compounded revenue growth over the
last three years. Our growth potential for Middle Market business isn’t just
limited to our expansion markets. Through data-driven analysis, we’ve
identified nearly 38,000 prospective clients nationally. Some of our most
exciting opportunities are within our legacy markets like New York, Chicago,
Dallas and Houston, where we have been for over a century.
• Chase’s retail branch expansion amplifies our opportunity to deepen
relationships with clients who already are in those markets by giving them
access to branches and the additional resources that come with that access.
In addition, the expansion opens the opportunity to serve more public
sector customers in new U.S. markets through our Government Banking
business, deepening community engagement and broadening our work with
cities, states, public universities and other municipal clients.
• Commercial Banking’s partnership with the Corporate & Investment Bank
continues to be highly successful and is a key growth driver for both
businesses. Being able to deliver the #1 investment bank locally enhances
our strategic dialogue with our clients and separates us from our
competitors. In 2018, 39% of the firm’s North America investment banking
fees came from Commercial Banking clients, totaling $2.5 billion in revenue,
up from $1 billion 10 years ago. We expect that number to continue to grow.
Asset & Wealth
Management
• We are using data and technology to transform how we interact with clients.
By integrating our human expertise with distinctive digital offerings like You
Invest, we have been able to attract new clients, 89% of whom are first-time
investors with Chase.
• We are expanding our footprint to capture more of the opportunity across
the U.S. wealth management spectrum — from mass affluent ($500,000 to
$3 million) to high-net-worth ($3 million to $10 million) to ultra-high-networth ($10 million or greater). By the end of 2019, we expect to have 6,500
advisors globally on the ground where our clients need us most.
• We have continued to innovate our product lineup by adding 47 index funds
and exchange-traded funds (ETF) over the last three years.

2. We endeavor to be the best at anything and everything we do.
While we never expect to be best-in-class
every year in every business, we normally
compare well with our best-in-class peers.
The chart below shows our performance
generally, by business, versus our competitors in terms of efficiency and returns.
On an ongoing basis, we analyze and
compare ourselves with our competitors
at a very detailed level. The analysis we do
is on more than 50 sub-lines of business
and hundreds of products, incorporating
not just financial data but also operational
data, customer satisfaction and many other
measures. Our management will always be
very critical of its own performance: Acknowledging our shortcomings and mistakes and
studying them intensely and learning from
them make for a stronger company.

We also never lose sight of the fact that we
have an extraordinary number of strong
competitors – we cannot be complacent.
There are many capable financial technology (fintech) companies in the United
States and around the world – technology
always creates opportunities for disruption.
We have acknowledged that companies like
Square and PayPal have done things that we
could have done but did not. They looked at
clients’ problems, improved straight through
processing, added data and analytics to products, and moved quickly. We recently sent
one of our senior teams to China to study
what’s being achieved there with artificial
intelligence (AI) and fintech, and it’s hard
not to be both impressed and a little worried
about the progress China has made – it made
our management team even more motivated
to move quickly. Suffice it to say, no matter
what our current performance is, we cannot
rest on our laurels.
3. We will maintain a fortress balance sheet — and fortress financial principles.
A fortress company starts with a fortress
balance sheet.
You can see in the chart below that our
balance sheet is extraordinarily strong.

I. JPMORGAN CHASE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
We have an incredibly well-capitalized bank
with enormous liquidity.
But a fortress balance sheet isn’t enough.
To be a fortress company, we believe that
you also need to have strong, properly diversified earnings and margins. It is capital
and liquidity combined with strong earnings and margins that provide the ability to
withstand extreme stress. I want to remind
shareholders that we run hundreds of
stress tests internally each month, some of
which are far more severe than the Federal
Reserve’s (the Fed) annual stress test. We
also believe that we should have strong
earnings after making investments for the
future – which may reduce earnings in the
short run. We are cost- and capital-efficient;
we rigorously allocate our capital; and we
continually analyze our businesses, both to
maximize their individual performance and
to make sure they are contributing to the
health of the whole company.
We like to use our capital to grow.
We much prefer to use our capital to grow
than to buy back stock. We believe buying
back stock should be considered only when
either we cannot invest (sometimes as a
result of regulatory policies) or we are generating excess capital that we do not expect to
use in the next few years. Buybacks should
not be done at the expense of investing
appropriately in our company. Investing
for the future should come first, and at
JPMorgan Chase, it does.
However, when you cannot see a clear use
for your excess capital over the short term,
buying back stock is an important capital
tool – as long as you are buying it back at
a reasonable price. And when companies
buy back stock (which we only do when it
is at a price that we think adds value to our
remaining shareholders), the capital is redistributed to investors who can put it to good
use elsewhere. It does not disappear. We
currently have excess capital, but we hope in
the future to be able to invest more of it to
grow our businesses.
Good financial management is also critical.
We have always believed that a deep and
detailed understanding of a company’s financial and operational statements, including
all assets and liabilities and all revenue and
expenses (without netting and regardless of
whether they are on- or off-balance sheet), is
critical to running a safe and sound organization. However, accounting, and therefore
earnings, is not a perfect measure of performance or economics. I would like to discuss
a few reasons why:
• Accounting rules can be counterintuitive,
but you can’t make business decisions based
on them. While we are rigorous about
proper accounting and disclosure, sometimes accounting can distort the actual
economics of a business. A few examples
will suffice. In credit card accounting, for
instance, new card customer costs are
expensed over the course of a year and
inexplicably as a contra-revenue item
(i.e., as a reduction of revenue rather
than an expense). In addition, under
upcoming accounting rules, losses that are
expected over the life of the card balance
are accounted for upfront. Meanwhile,
the earnings from the card are booked
over the life of the card, which averages
approximately seven years. In connection
with mortgage loans we don’t own but
instead service (i.e., by sending statements
and receiving payments on behalf of
the mortgagor), the accounting standard
requires that we present-value expected
revenue and expenses and book everything upfront. But in cash management,
asset management and many other products that have a similar, somewhat predictable annuity-like revenue stream, the practice is different. The reason I am making
this point is that you need to understand
the economics of decisions. Accounting
can easily make people do silly things.
18
I. JPMORGAN CHASE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
• Conservative accounting is better. While we
always try to make intelligent economic
decisions, I do believe that appropriately
conservative accounting is a better way to
manage your business. For example, recognize problems early, write off software
that is not valuable, don’t book revenue
that is uncertain and so on. Aggressive
accounting leads to trouble, and while it
may help increase performance measures
in the short run, it will most certainly be
uncovered and reversed at precisely the
wrong time.
• Earnings guidance can be very damaging.
Let’s be very clear: Transparency with
shareholders, proper disclosures and
guidance on certain revenue, expense
and balance sheet items all are good.
However, earnings themselves in any one
quarter are a function of decisions made
over many, many years. Quarterly earnings are dependent upon many factors,
like cost of goods sold and market prices,
which often change, as well as unexpected events, the weather, and wage and
gross domestic product (GDP) growth. No
CEO can predict all of those things, and
any analyst with an earnings estimate
has made his or her own specific assumptions around them.
The real damage to an organization
comes from the cumulative corrosiveness of trying to “make” its numbers.
This can be exacerbated by compensation deals and models that can be
manipulated to change quarterly results.
It’s easy to change earnings in a quarter
by doing stupid things that help earnings in the short term but are bad in
the long term. Examples include asking
customers to inappropriately buy more
products before the end of the quarter so
you can show revenue growth, reducing
marketing, not opening that new branch
or not investing in technology that won’t
have a payback for a year or two. I could
go on and on. And this could spiral
within a company, as loyal, well-meaning
employees do what they can to help a
company meet its “earnings goal.”
Importantly, in the next section, I speak
in detail about responsible banking, client
selection and intensive risk management.
Proper management is as critical as anything
else we do, but I did not want to repeat the
messages here.
4. We lift up our communities.
We will never forget that the most important
thing we do is to run a healthy and vibrant
company that is here to constantly serve our
clients with responsible banking. But we
want our shareholders and all of our constituents to understand the tremendous amount
we do, in addition to traditional banking, to
help the communities in which we operate.
Our effort is substantial, permanent and
supported by the whole company.
One of the reasons for JPMorgan Chase’s
enduring success is we have always recognized that long-term business success
depends on community success. When
everyone has a fair shot at participating in
and sharing in the rewards of growth, the
economy will be stronger and our society
will be better. We are making significant,
long-term, data-driven business and philanthropic investments aimed at opening doors
to opportunity for those being left behind.
Most people consider corporate responsibility to be enhanced philanthropy. While
we are devoted to philanthropy (we are on
our way to spending $350 million a year
on these efforts), corporate responsibility
is far more than just that. We finance more
than $2 billion in affordable housing each 
19
I. JPMORGAN CHASE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
year; we do extensive lending in low- and
moderate-income neighborhoods; we lend
to and finance small businesses around
the country; and we design products and
services in financial education for lower
income individuals. And importantly, these
efforts are supported by senior leadership,
managed by some of our best people (these
efforts are not an afterthought) and are
sustainable. We try to be creative, but we
analyze everything, including philanthropy,
based on expected results.
We are huge supporters of regional and
community banks, which are critical to many
cities and small towns around the country.
In an op-ed published by The Wall Street
Journal in 2016, I wrote: “In this system,
regional and smaller community banks play
an indispensable role. They sit close to the
communities they serve; their highestranking corporate officers live in the same
neighborhoods as their clients. They are able
to forge deep and long-standing relationships and bring a keen knowledge of the
local economy and culture. They frequently
are able to provide high-touch and specialized banking services.” JPMorgan Chase,
as a traditional “money center bank” and
“bankers’ bank,” in fact, is the largest banker
in America to regional and community
banks. We bank approximately 530 of
America’s 5,200 regional and community
banks. In 2018, we made loans to them or
raised capital for them totaling $4 billion. In
addition, we process payments for them, we
finance some of their mortgage activities,
we advise them on acquisitions, and we buy
and sell securities for them. We also provide
them with interest rate swaps and foreign
exchange both for themselves – to help
them hedge some of their exposures – and
for their clients.
Over the past five years, we have developed
and refined a model that may be a blueprint for urban revitalization and inclusive
growth. Our head of Corporate Responsibility describes our significant measures in
more detail in his letter, but I highlight a
few examples here, including the sidebar on
page 20 that describes our focused effort to
support black advancement in a number of
the communities we serve:
• Detroit exemplifies the challenges many cities
wrestle with, as well as the strategies for
solving them. Since 2014, JPMorgan Chase
has been combining its philanthropy
and business expertise to address some
of Detroit’s biggest economic hurdles,
ranging from catalyzing development,
building infrastructure and affordable
housing, and boosting small business
growth to revitalizing education and
preparing Detroiters with the skills to
secure well-paying jobs. We are deeply
proud of our $150 million commitment
and the impact we have made to date –
the city has been the proving ground for
our model for driving inclusive growth,
which has made a real difference in
Detroit’s comeback and the lives of its
citizens. Over the past five years, we have
taken lessons learned and applied them to
other cities facing similar challenges.
• The Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (EOCF) is
another example of how we are turning our
insights into action. In 2015, JPMorgan
Chase helped launch the Entrepreneurs of
Color Fund in Detroit to provide underserved entrepreneurs with access to
capital and assistance needed to grow and
thrive. From 2015 to 2018, the fund made or
approved loans totaling $6.6 million to 79
minority small businesses, resulting in over
830 new or preserved jobs. Since then, the
Detroit fund has more than tripled in size
to over $22 million. Building on the success
of Detroit’s EOCF, we expanded this model
to San Francisco, the South Bronx, the
Greater Washington region and Chicago,
where it is also making a real impact. In
total, these funds are now approximately
$40 million and growing.
20
ADVANCING BLACK PATHWAYS: from an op-ed that originally ran on CNN Business
Mellody Hobson and Jamie Dimon:
Black Americans are still worse off
financially. Businesses can help.
For all the positive economic trends in America, the racial wealth
gap continues to prevent growth from benefiting everyone. While
this is not a new crisis, it is one we must urgently address so that
economic opportunity is equally extended to black Americans.
Racism, intolerance, and poverty strangle economic opportunity.
The racial wealth gap is stark: For single black Americans, the
median wealth is $200 to $300, compared to $15,000 to $28,000
for single white Americans. This divide undermines financial
stability for many black Americans.
Closing the racial wealth gap is good for Americans, and it
makes good business sense. We know employees from diverse
backgrounds offering different perspectives drive better
corporate outcomes. A recent study showed that businesses
with diverse leadership generate 19% more revenue than
non-diverse companies.
Diversity can also reduce turnover. Nearly seven in 10 millennials
reported they would continue to work at a company for five or
more years if it is diverse.
As leaders in business as well as the broader community, we know
we have a responsibility to society. Not to mention, as financial
services executives, we can help to foster widespread prosperity.
To this end, we have both worked to empower black Americans
to achieve personal and professional success. For example, After
School Matters, a nonprofit founded in 2000, provides enrichment programs to thousands of inner-city high school students in
Chicago. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase’s Fellowship Initiative,
founded in 2010, offers hands-on college access and academic
support to young men of color in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago
and Dallas. The scale and success of these efforts are impressive
— but not enough. There is much more work to be done.
Recently, we announced Advancing Black Pathways — a new
program at JPMorgan Chase that seeks to build on existing
efforts to bridge the racial wealth divide and ultimately help
black families build wealth. We urge more businesses to join us
as we attempt to close this divide.
Our current initiative, Advancing Black Leaders, seeks to hire and
promote more black senior executives and junior-level employees
at JPMorgan Chase. We know investing in our employees is key
to our company’s future. In addition to recruiting more AfricanAmerican leaders, we also need to focus on retaining them. Since
2016, the firm has increased the number of black managing
directors by 41% and black executive directors by 53%. A good
start — but just the beginning.
Advancing Black Pathways will create a dedicated talent pipeline
that will start young black professionals on an early career path
and foster a corporate culture that further encourages diversity
at all levels. We plan to hire more than 4,000 black students in
full-time positions, apprenticeships, and internships over the
next five years. JPMorgan Chase will also help create job training
programs that are aligned with growing industries in the broader
communities we serve.
We are also investing in the financial success of black Americans
through a focus on savings, homeownership, and entrepreneurship. For example, the largest wealth gaps lie in racial disparities
among entrepreneurs. If people of color owned businesses at the
same rates as whites, 9 million more jobs and $300 billion in
income would be created.
As part of this effort, we are helping to create a $6.65 million
Entrepreneurs of Color Fund with local partners in the Washington, D.C. region to expand access to capital, improve business
services, and streamline supplier diversity programs for small,
minority-owned businesses. To date, we have launched similar
low-cost loan funds in four other U.S. cities, bringing other
investors to the table, and leveraging nearly $40 million to
support underserved entrepreneurs. Thus far, Entrepreneurs of
Color Funds have created or saved more than 1,200 jobs in
critical neighborhoods lacking needed resources to grow.
Businesses of every size have an important role to play in
expanding opportunity. By working together, we can give people
a fair and equal chance to succeed, no matter their zip code or
skin color.

I. JPMORGAN CHASE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
• In 2018, we launched AdvancingCities,
JPMorgan Chase’s $500 million, five-year
initiative to drive inclusive growth in cities
around the world. Through this effort, we
are combining our business and philanthropic resources and expertise to expand
opportunity for those being left behind
in today’s economy. This is a global
program. Marking our firm’s 150th anniversary in France last year, we announced
a $30 million, five-year commitment –
the first AdvancingCities investment – to
support underserved small businesses
and provide skills training to residents
in Seine-Saint-Denis and other areas in
Greater Paris with high levels of poverty
and unemployment.
• Our recent $350 million New Skills at Work
commitment is focused on how we prepare
people to succeed in our transformed workplaces and changing global economy. Over the
past five years, we have supported worker
education and training around the world
– collaborating with nearly 750 partners
and nonprofits in 37 countries and 30
U.S. states, affecting 150,000 individuals.
We are now bolstering our strategy by
promoting better ways for business and
education to collaborate, scaling the best
education and job training programs.
While we know a fundamental disconnect
still remains between business and the
average citizen, we also believe that the only
solution is to remain relentless in our efforts
to earn trust from every customer in every
community. We believe that is the best we
can do. As the largest financial institution in
the country, JPMorgan Chase understands
our responsibility to earn public trust with
everyone, every day.
When disaster strikes, we give special care to
our customers.
When disaster strikes – we are there for our
customers. After Hurricane Florence and
Hurricane Michael devastated the Carolinas and the Gulf Coast, respectively, after
wildfires destroyed large parts of California
and after a number of other tragic events,
we stepped up for our communities and
our customers. We also provided relief to
customers affected by the recent government
shutdown – and kept at it until they received
their back pay. Here’s a list of the kinds of
things we did when disaster struck:
• Re-entered damaged areas, often as the
first bank, filling our ATMs and quickly
reopening our branches to give customers
access to cash, as well as crucial documents in their safe deposit box.
• Activated our special-care line with
specialists to quickly help customers.
• Refunded customers’ overdraft fees.
• Extended and deferred payments on
customers’ car loans.
• Provided necessary relief on customers’
mortgage loans.
• Removed minimum payments on credit
cards, reducing cash payments and
limiting the impact on customer credit
reports.
• In addition, in 2018, donated more than $4
million to emergency assistance agencies
around the world, which included immediate help following the earthquake and
tsunami in Indonesia, wildfires in Greece,
and devastating floods and landslides in
western Japan.
• Over the past five years, contributed more
than $22 million to support immediate
and long-term recovery from disasters.

5. We take care of our employees.
Our employees are fundamental to the
vibrancy and success of our company. At
the end of the day, everything we do – from
operations and technology to service and
reputation – is completely based upon the
abilities and character of our employees.
Inclusion and diversity
• We have more than 256,000 employees
globally, with over 170,000 in the United
States. Our commitment to creating an
inclusive organization is not only about
doing the right thing; it’s about doing
what makes our company stronger. In
2016, we introduced Advancing Black
Leaders, an expanded diversity strategy
focused on increased hiring, retention
and development of talent from within
the black community. We magnified that
effort in 2019 with our Advancing Black
Pathways initiative (which is outlined
in the sidebar on page 20). Now, in the
United States, 50% of our firm’s workforce
is ethnically diverse. That said, we know
we have work to do to increase the representation of ethnically diverse employees
at senior levels of the company.
• On gender diversity, women represent
30% of our firm’s senior leadership globally. These are women who run major
businesses and functions – several units
on their own would be among Fortune
1000 companies. Investing in the advancement of women is a key focus for our
company, and we have established a global
firmwide initiative called Women on the
Move that empowers female employees,
clients and consumers to build their
career, grow their businesses and improve
their financial health.
• To encourage diversity and inclusion
in the workplace, we have 10 Business Resource Groups (BRG) across the
company to connect approximately
100,000 participating employees around
common interests, as well as foster
networking and camaraderie. Groups are
defined by shared affinities, including
race and cultural heritage, generation,
gender, sexual orientation, disability and
military status. For example, some of our
largest BRGs are Adelante for Hispanic
and Latino employees, Access Ability for
employees who have a disability, AsPIRE
for Asian and Pacific Islander employees,
NextGen for early career professionals,
PRIDE for our LGBT+ employees, BOLD
for black employees and Women on the
Move, our largest group, which has more
than 30,000 members globally.
Wages
• We have been raising wages for our
22,000 employees at the lower end of the
pay range. For those earning between $12
and $16.50 an hour in the United States,
we have been increasing hourly wages to
between $15 and $18, depending on the
local cost of living. For employees making
$40,000 a year or less in the United States,
our average pay increases are around
$4,800. This is the right thing to do, and
we now offer well above the average
hourly wage for most markets. Remember,
these jobs are often the first rung on the
ladder, and many of these employees soon
move on to higher paying positions.
• These increases are on top of the firm’s
comprehensive benefits package, with an
average value of $12,000 for employees in
the lower wage tier.
23
I. JPMORGAN CHASE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
401(k) — Retirement
• We provide comprehensive retirement
benefits, including a competitive 401(k)
plan and dollar-for-dollar match on 5%
of pay. For 2018, the 401(k) plan match,
totaling approximately $482 million,
enhanced the retirement savings of
135,000 employees.
• We recognize that many employees
who earn under $60,000 a year often
do not invest in a 401(k) plan because
they cannot afford the lost cash flow
and, therefore, do not receive the match.
For these employees, we make a discretionary $750 Special Award to them. This
provided 56,000 U.S. employees with $40
million in additional retirement funds –
and this money is granted whether or not
they make their own contribution to a
401(k) plan.
Health benefits and wellness programs
• We offer a comprehensive health benefits
package in the United States, including
a medical plan that covers over 296,000
individuals (138,000 employees, 106,000
children and 52,000 spouses/domestic
partners). In 2018, we covered $1.3 billion
in medical costs (net of employee payroll
contributions). We care very much about
our employees’ health.
• We subsidize the health benefit costs of
lower wage earners up to 90% of the
total cost – for higher paid employees,
we subsidize approximately 60%. In
addition, recognizing the hardship
that deductibles cause for lower paid
employees, effective January 1, 2018, we
lowered the deductible in the medical
plan by $750 for employees earning less
than $60,000. For these employees, if
they do their wellness screenings, their
effective deductible could be zero.
• Enrolled employees and spouses/
domestic partners earned collectively
about $100 million toward their Medical
Reimbursement Accounts in 2018, funded
by JPMorgan Chase, for completing wellness activities.
• Outside the United States, we provide
medical coverage to 80,000 employees
and their families under local medical
insurance plans.
• 62% of employees around the globe have
access to our 54 on-site Health & Wellness
Centers, which are staffed with doctors,
nurses, nurse practitioners and other
health professionals. These centers are
extensively visited – in excess of 600,000
encounters a year. And over 100 visits
were potentially life-saving interventions
(involving, for example, urgent cardiac or
respiratory issues).
Training
• We extensively invest in employee benefits and training opportunities so that our
workers can continue to increase their
skills and advance their career. Our total
direct investment in training and development is approximately $250 million
a year. What’s more important and hard
to measure is the on-the-job training that
just about every employee gets from their
manager – education that leads to deep
knowledge and promotion opportunities
(and, unfortunately, lots of recruiting from
our competitors). In 2018, we delivered 9
million hours of training to our employees
worldwide, augmented by several new
digital learning innovations.
• Since inception of the program in 2015,
26,500 managers (approximately 60% of
all managers) have attended one or more
Leadership Edge programs. These offer
critical training in leadership and management. While this initiative is costly, we
are starting to see results in terms of
reduced attrition, higher satisfaction from
employees and better management.
Volunteer and Employee Engagement Paid Time
Off policy
• Effective January 1, 2019, we implemented
a new Volunteer and Employee Engagement Paid Time Off policy, which provides
up to eight hours of paid time off each
calendar year for volunteer and other
firm-sponsored activities. 
24
I. JPMORGAN CHASE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
• The new policy increases opportunities for
employees to participate in volunteer activities and give back to our communities.
Parental Leave policy
• In 2017, we increased paid parental leave
for the primary caregiver to 16 weeks, up
from 12 weeks, for eligible employees in
the United States. In 2018, we extended
the leave for non-primary parental caregivers to six weeks of paid time off (up
from two weeks).
Supporting veterans
• Our veteran-focused efforts are centered
on facilitating success in veterans’ postservice lives primarily through employment and retention. In 2011, JPMorgan
Chase and 10 other companies launched
the 100,000 Jobs Mission, setting a goal
of collectively hiring 100,000 veterans.
The initiative has resulted in the hiring
of more than 500,000 veterans by over
200 member companies of the Veteran
Jobs Mission, with the ultimate goal of
employing 1 million veterans.
• JPMorgan Chase has hired more than
14,000 U.S. veterans since 2011 – including
over 1,100 in 2018 alone – with more than
50% coming from diverse backgrounds.
• We offer internship and rotational entry
programs to ease the transition from
military service to the financial services
industry. Once at our firm, veterans
can count on the support of our Office
of Military and Veterans Affairs, which
sponsors mentorship programs, acclimation and development initiatives, recognition events and other programs to help
bridge the gap between military and
corporate cultures.
• More than 1,000 mortgage-free homes have
been awarded to military families through
nonprofit partners as part of our firm’s
Military Home Awards Program.
• We completely support the U.S. military.
We cannot understand how any U.S.
citizen does not support the extraordinary
sacrifice and hardship borne by the military to help protect this great nation.
Needless to say, our success is impossible
without our employees, and we strive
mightily to help them in both their professional and personal lives.
6. We always strive to learn more about management and leadership.
At the end of the day, everything we do is
done by human beings. In my annual letter
to shareholders, I always enjoy sharing what
we have learned about management, leadership and organizations over time.
Great management is critical, though true
leadership requires more.
For any large organization, great management is critical to its long-term success. Great
management is disciplined and rigorous.
Facts, analysis, detail … facts, analysis, detail
… repeat. You can never do enough, and
it does not end. Complex activity requires
hard work and not guessing. Test, test, test
and learn, learn, learn. And accept failure
as a “normal” recurring outcome. Develop
great models but know that they are not the
answer – judgment has to be involved in
matters related to human beings. You need
to have good decision-making processes,
with the right people in the room, the proper
dissemination of information and the appropriate follow-up – all to get to the right decision. Force urgency and kill complacency.
Know that there is competition everywhere,
all the time. But even if you do all of this
well, it is not enough.
25
I. JPMORGAN CHASE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
Real leadership requires heart and humility.
It’s possible to be very good at the type
of management described above, but as
managers rise in an organization, they
depend on others more and more. The team
is increasingly important – many team
members know more than their managers
do about certain issues – a team working
together can get to a better outcome. I have
seen many senior managers ascend into
big new roles with a bad reaction to their
increasing dependence on other people – by
hoarding information, never allowing themselves to be embarrassed and demanding
personal loyalty versus loyalty to the organization and its principles. They don’t grow
into the new job – they swell into it. I have
often felt that dependency on their teams
makes these folks feel paranoid or insecure –
leading to this bad behavior.
Good leaders have the humility to know that
they don’t know everything. They foster an
environment of openness and sharing. They
earn trust and respect. There are no “friends
of the boss” – everyone gets equal treatment.
The door is universally open to everybody.
Since we shared issues that are high priorities, it is almost as important to describe the
issues we don’t worry about daily – and why.
A few are listed below:
• We do not worry about the stock price in
the short run. If you continue to build a
great company, the stock price will take
care of itself.
• We do not worry about quarterly earnings.
Build the company for the future, and you
will maximize earnings over the long run.
• While we worry extensively about all
of the risks we bear, we essentially do
not worry about things like fluctuating
markets and short-term economic reports.
We simply manage through them.
Everyone knows that these leaders are only
trying to do the right thing for customers and
clients. They share the credit when things go
well and take the blame when it does not.
And true leaders don’t just show they care
– they actually do care. While they demand
hard work and effort, they work as hard as
anyone, and they have deep empathy for
their employees under any type of stress.
They are patriots not mercenaries; they have
the heart to wear the jersey every day.
You need to stay hungry and scrappy.
Competition is everywhere, but, often, very
successful companies are lulled into a false
sense of security. Having worked at a number
of companies not nearly as successful as ours
(I have to confess that I kind of liked being
the underdog), we fought every day to even
try to get to the major leagues. All companies
are subject to inertia, insipid bureaucracy and
other flaws, which must be eradicated. If a
company isn’t staying on edge, maintaining
a fire in its belly and pushing forward, it will
eventually fail.
7. We do not worry about some issues.
• We do not worry about loan growth. It
is most definitely an outcome of how we
manage credit and client decisions. We will
not stretch, ever, to show growth in loans.
• While we fanatically manage our
company, we do not worry about missing
revenue or expense budgets for good
reasons. This is not a mixed message. We
want our leaders to do the right thing for
the long term and explain it if they have
good reasons to diverge from prior plans.
• We do not worry about charge-offs
increasing in a recession – we fully expect
it, and we manage our business knowing
there will be good times and bad times.
Suffice it to say, we stay devoted to these
principles.
26
In this section, I review and analyze some of the current critical issues that affect our company.
An enormous amount has been accomplished in
the last decade.
The strength, stability and resiliency of the
financial system have been fundamentally
improved over the course of the last 10 years.
While I don’t agree with all of the Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DoddFrank) regulations, the bill did give regulators
needed authority to fix our financial system’s
most critical flaws. These post-crisis reforms
have made banks much safer and sounder
in the three most important areas: capital,
liquidity, and resolution and recovery.
Large banks, defined as global systemically
important financial institutions, have more
than doubled their highest quality capital to
protect against losses, and they have tripled
their liquid assets to total assets ratio to protect
against unexpected net cash outflows. This
allows healthy banks to weather extreme stress
while continuing to provide credit and support
to their clients (see message to employees on
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
pages 27-28 that describes many of the lessons
learned from the crisis and the extensive steps
we took to help our clients).
Here’s an eye-opening example of how much
capital is now in the system: Under the Fed’s
most extreme stress-testing scenario, where 35
of the largest American banks bear extreme
losses (as if each were the worst bank in the
system), the combined losses are about 6% of
the total loss absorbing resources of those 35
banks. JPMorgan Chase alone has nearly three
times the loss absorbing resources to cover
the projected losses of all of these 35 banks
(see chart below).
In addition, resolution and recovery regulations have given regulators both the legal
authority and the tools to manage a failing
or failed institution (see my comments in
the sidebar on page 29 about how Lehman
Brothers would have played out under
today’s new rules). This allows regulators to
minimize the impact of a major failed institution on both taxpayers and the system.

Looking back on
the financial crisis
Dear Colleagues,
A decade has passed since the collapse of Lehman Brothers so now is a good time to reflect on the financial
crisis that was raging 10 years ago this month. A lot has been written — and far more is still to be written
— on this crisis, but I would like to share a few thoughts with you on that extraordinary period of time and
everything that all of you at JPMorgan Chase did to try to help.
The gathering storm hit with a vengeance.
While the collapse of Lehman in September 2008 was the epicenter of the crisis, it was actually far more
complex than that — the roots go back to before 2006. By late 2006, we already saw problems in subprime
mortgages, leveraged lending and quantitative investing. With the onset of Basel II, leverage at investment
banks (not commercial banks) more than doubled, as did shadow banking (think structured investment
vehicles, collateralized debt obligations, money market funds and so on). This was often funded by
unsecured, undependable short-term wholesale borrowing. Then the biggest problem of all presented
itself: It was not just subprime mortgages that were flawed — but all mortgages. This happened, in hindsight, by bad underwriting, government policy that fueled and fostered inappropriate mortgage lending
(higher and higher loan-to-values, less and less cash down, weaker appraisals and insufficient income
certification), unscrupulous brokers and cavalier investors. The banks, though not the worst actors in
mortgages, joined the party, too. When the world realized that $1 trillion would ultimately be lost in
mortgages, panic ensued. There were multiple failures — mortgage brokers, savings and loans (S&L),
including Washington Mutual (WaMu) and IndyMac, as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (which were
the largest financial failures of all time) — culminating in the dramatic failure of Lehman, followed by
the extraordinary bailouts of AIG and other major financial institutions.
JPMorgan Chase did everything it possibly could do to help during this time.
On March 16, 2008, we announced our acquisition of Bear Stearns, a company with $300 billion of assets,
which had collapsed and had fatal problems (we were essentially buying a house … but it was a house on
fire). And we did this at the request of the U.S. government (thinking at the time that this could help head
off a terrible crisis). On September 25, 2008, 10 days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, we bought the
largest S&L — WaMu — another company that had $300 billion of assets. We took other extraordinary actions
— often at calculated but great risk to JPMorgan Chase — to support clients, including governments, and to
support the markets in general. We loaned $70 billion in the global interbank market when it was needed
most. With markets in complete turmoil, we were the only bank willing to single-handedly lend $4 billion to
the state of California, $2 billion to the state of New Jersey and $1 billion to the state of Illinois. Additionally
— and frequently — we loaned or raised for our clients $1.3 trillion at consistent and fair rates, in many cases
far below what the market would have demanded, and we provided more than $100 billion to local governments, municipalities, schools, hospitals and not-for-profits over the course of 2009. Many other banks did
the same. You probably will be surprised to find out that we lent a tremendous amount of money to Lehman
before the crisis — and even more after the crisis. In fact, at the request of the Federal Reserve, we took
extraordinary risk to lend more than $80 billion (on a secured basis) to Lehman after its bankruptcy to help
facilitate sales of assets in as orderly a way as possible to minimize disruption in the markets.
September 2018 message to employees 10 years after the financial crisis
28
This was a traumatic, historic period of time not just for the financial system but for the world as a whole.
We endured a once-in-a-generation economic, political and social storm, and because of you, we have
emerged 10 years after this crisis as a company of which we can all be proud.
The aftermath and lessons learned.
Many people still ask me about the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a government program that
provided funding to banks in the midst of the crisis. JPMorgan Chase did not want or need TARP money,
but we recognized that if the healthy banks did not take it, no one else could — out of fear that the market
would lose confidence in them. And while it helped create the false rallying cry that all the banks needed
support, the government, both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, was trying everything it could in
addition to TARP. And the Federal Reserve and the Treasury should be congratulated for the extraordinary
actions they took to stave off a far worse crisis. In hindsight, it is easy to criticize any specific action, but,
in total, the government succeeded in avoiding a calamity.
There were many lessons learned from the crisis: the need for plenty of capital and liquidity, proper
underwriting and regulations that are constantly refined, fair and appropriate. In fact, regulators should
take a victory lap because Lehman, Bear Stearns, AIG and multiple other failures effectively could not
happen today because of the new rules and requirements.
We entered the crisis with the capital, liquidity, earnings, diversity of businesses, people and a risk
management culture that enabled us to avoid most — but, unfortunately, not all — of the issues exposed by
the crisis. These strengths also helped us to weather the economic crisis and to continue to play a central
role in supporting our clients and our communities and rebuilding the U.S. economy. Counter to what most
people think, many of the extreme actions we took were not done to make a profit: They were done to
support our country and the financial system.
What stood out most was our character and capabilities — which make JPMorgan Chase what it is today.
When the global financial crisis unfolded in 2008, the people of JPMorgan Chase understood the vital role
our firm needed to play and felt a deep responsibility to those who rely on us. It was this sense of responsibility that enabled us to move beyond the challenges we were facing at that time and maintain a focus
on what really matters: Taking care of our clients, helping the communities in which we operate — all while
under extreme pressure from both the markets and the body politic — and protecting our company.
How we managed through the crisis is a testimony to the collective strength of character and commitment
of our people. During those chaotic days throughout the crisis and its aftermath, many of our people had
to work around the clock, seven days a week, for months on end. And they did it without complaint. The
biggest lesson of the crisis: The quality, character, culture and capabilities of your partners are paramount.
Looking back and then looking around at the company we are today, I am filled with awe and admiration.
For JPMorgan Chase, these past 10 years have been part of a challenging, yet defining, decade. Today,
JPMorgan Chase is among the leaders in most of our businesses. I can’t tell you how proud I am to be your
partner and to witness your extraordinary performance. I can’t thank our current and former employees
enough for helping us get through those turbulent times and for the company we have become.
29
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
2. We have to remind ourselves that responsible banking is good and safe banking.
One of the critical responsibilities of banks is
to take a rigorous and disciplined approach
to allocating capital in the financial system –
whether they do it directly through loans or
through public and private capital markets.
Banks need to do this knowing there will
be recessions and that they should plan to
support their clients through their most difficult times. We did exactly that throughout
the 2008 crisis (again, see message to
employees on pages 27-28). While many
people focus on market making, which of
course entails risk (we buy and sell about $2
trillion a day of various securities around the
world), this risk taking is carefully monitored and largely hedged. To put risk taking
and market making a little bit in perspective
– in the last five years, we have lost money
trading on only 11 days, and the loss was
usually small and never more than about
two times the average normal trading day
revenue. Overall, loans are still the biggest
risk that banks take. Our loan losses last year
were $5 billion, and in the worst year of the
Great Recession, our loan losses were approximately $24 billion.
Responsible banks cannot always give customers
what they want.
Making bad and unworthy loans ultimately
is bad for both the bank and the customer.
Being a responsible bank means you can’t
always give customers what they want,
and, therefore, it is unlikely that all of your
customers are going to like you. We are
fundamentally not in the same position
as most businesses. If a customer has the
money, most businesses will sell their goods
and services to that customer. Banks can’t do
that. Sometimes we have to say no or enforce
LEHMAN REDUX — IT SIMPLY WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED, BUT IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN EASILY MANAGEABLE IF IT DID FAIL
As I mentioned in my shareholder letter in 2016, it is instructive to look at what would happen
if Lehman were to fail in today’s regulatory regime. First of all, it is highly unlikely the firm
would fail because under today’s capital rules, Lehman’s equity capital would be approximately
$45 billion instead of $23 billion, which it was in 2007. In addition, Lehman would have far
stronger liquidity and “bail-inable” debt. And finally, the firm would be forced to raise capital
much earlier in the process. Lehman simply would not have failed.
However, if by the remotest, shooting-star possibility Lehman failed anyway, regulators would
now have the legal authority to put the firm in receivership (they did not have that ability
back in 2007-2008). At the moment of failure, unsecured debt of approximately $120 billion
would be immediately converted to equity. “New Lehman” would be the best-capitalized
bank in the world. In addition, derivatives contracts would not be triggered, and cash would
continue to move through the pipes of the financial system. Legislators and regulators should
be applauded for what they have done to solve the Too Big to Fail problem, though I should
point out that this was accomplished by putting some basic rules in place — not the thousands
of other rules layered atop them. 
30
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
rules that may be unpopular. I have always
believed that this necessary discipline with
customers is one of the reasons that, historically, banks have not been popular.
Banks are under constant pressure, including
political pressure, to make loans (remember
subprime mortgages?) even when they
should not. But when and if something goes
wrong with loans, even when proper and
responsible underwriting is done, banks will
come under a lot of legal, regulatory and
political scrutiny and should expect to be
blamed for potentially causing the problem.
These conflicting pressures – to make or not
make loans – will always exist and need to be
properly navigated by a good bank.
Client selection is critical.
Client selection is one of the most important
things we do. If one bank builds a book of
business with clients of high character and
another bank builds its business with clients
of low character (who are usually pushing
sound banking practices to the limit), it’s
clear which bank will succeed over time.
Therefore, turning down clients, which can
sometimes be hard to do, is often the only
way to be a responsible bank.
Risk taking is a detailed, analytical process and
includes extensive risk mitigation.
Shareholders may be surprised to find out
that, fundamentally, we are not a risk-taking
but rather a risk-mitigating institution.
Risk mitigation is not guessing – it is a
thoughtful, detailed analytical process that
leads to measured decision making. Participants in our risk meetings can attest that
while we are adamant about serving clients,
we are also fanatic about understanding and
mitigating some of the associated risks. So,
in addition to proper client selection, risks
are mitigated through simplification, diversification, hedging, syndication, covenants,
hard limits, continuous monitoring and fast
reaction to problems. We deeply analyze
everything so we can shoulder appropriate
risk for and with our clients. We are their
financial partner.
A recent example in the oil and gas sector shows
how we balance risk while serving clients in
tough times.
From 2014 to 2016, oil prices collapsed from
a high of $108 per barrel to a low of $26
per barrel. We were carrying approximately
250 loans to smaller oil and gas companies
(mostly based in Houston), referred to in
the industry as “reserve-based loans,” or
RBLs. The proven oil and gas reserves in
the ground served as the collateral for these
loans, as reviewed by both J.P. Morgan’s
petroleum engineers and third-party engineering consultants. We had $3 billion in
outstanding loans under the RBL structure
(and more to the oil industry as a whole).
While we made these loans conservatively,
we knew that low oil prices at the bottom of
the cycle put us at great risk of loan losses
– maybe even as high as $500 million. Our
view was that we were going to work with
these borrowers; i.e., extend the loans and
try to help the companies survive this rough
patch. (Of course, we put up additional loan
loss reserves to account for possible losses.)
At one point, surprisingly, some regulators
made it clear that they did not want banks
to extend these loans because they were too
risky. But we thought it was important, even
at the risk of losing hundreds of millions
of dollars (something that we were positioned to be able to do), to help our clients
get through this tough time rather than
desert them when they needed us most. And
sticking with our clients is exactly what we
did. We thought regulators were overreacting
– and, indeed, our losses, ultimately, were
miniscule. Because of these actions, we are
still welcome in Houston.

3. We believe in good regulation — both to help America grow and improve financial stability.
I want to be very clear that we do not advocate for the repeal of Dodd-Frank. We believe
that the strength and resilience of the U.S.
financial system have benefited from the
law. Ten years out from the crisis, however, it
is appropriate for policymakers to examine
areas of our regulatory framework that
are excessive, overlapping, inefficient or
duplicative. At the same time, they should
identify areas where banks can promote
economic growth without impacting the very
important progress we have made on safety
and soundness. In fact, a stronger economy,
by definition, is a safer economy. Our goal
should be to achieve a rational, calibrated
approach to regulation that strikes the right
balance. This should be an ongoing and
rigorous process that does not require any
significant piece of legislation and should not
be politicized.
Here are a few areas where we think recalibration would be good not only for banks, but for
consumers and the economy as a whole:
• Carefully monitor the growing shadow bank
system. While we do not believe that the
rise in non-banks and shadow banking
has reached the point of systemic risk, the
growth in non-bank mortgage lending,
student lending, leveraged lending and
some consumer lending is accelerating
and needs to be assiduously monitored.
(We do this monitoring regularly as part
of our own business.) Growth in shadow
banking has been possible because rules
and regulations imposed upon banks
are not necessarily imposed upon these
non-bank lenders, which exemplifies the
risk of not having the new rules properly calibrated. An additional risk is that
many of these non-bank lenders will not
be able to continue lending in difficult
economic times – their borrowers will
become stranded. Banks traditionally try
to continue lending to their customers in
tough times.
• The country desperately needs mortgage
reform — it would add to America’s economic
growth. Reducing onerous and unnecessary origination and servicing requirements (there are 3,000 federal and state
requirements today) and opening up the
securitization markets for safe loans would
dramatically improve the cost and availability of mortgages to consumers – particularly the young, the self-employed and
those with prior defaults. And these would
not be subprime mortgages but mortgages
that we should be making. By taking this
step, our economists believe that homeownership and economic growth would
increase by up to 0.2% a year.
In the early 2000s, bad mortgage laws
helped create the Great Recession of 2008.
Today, bad mortgage rules are hindering
the healthy growth of the U.S. economy.
Because there are so many regulators
involved in crafting the new rules, coupled
with political intervention that isn’t
always helpful, it is hard to achieve the
much-needed mortgage reform. This has
become a critical issue and one reason
why banks have been moving away from
significant parts of the mortgage business. That business, in particular, highlights one of the flaws of our complicated
capital allocation regime. The best way to
risk manage a bank is to use risk weights
that are actually based on risk. However,
since most banks are also constrained by
standardized capital (a capital measure
that does not risk-adjust for the lower risk
of having a properly underwritten prime
mortgage), owning mortgages becomes
hugely unprofitable.
Because of these significant issues, we
are intensely reviewing our role in originating, servicing and holding mortgages.
The odds are increasing that we will
need to materially change our mortgage
strategy going forward.
32
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
We also need to get the recalibration of
other regulatory requirements right, particularly around operational risk capital, the
Fed’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and
Review (CCAR) stress test and the additional allocation of capital to global systemically important banks (GSIB). If we don’t
do so, certain products and services will
continue to be pushed outside the banking
system (where they are, fundamentally, not
regulated), distorting markets and raising
the cost of credit for clients.
• Operational risk capital. We now hold
nearly $400 billion of operational riskweighted assets, which means we hold
more than $40 billion of equity for assets
that don’t exist. This was a new calculation added after the crisis to recognize
that banks also bear serious operational
risk (stemming from lawsuits, processing
errors and other issues). I agree that all
banks bear operational risk, yet this is
also true for all companies. Most companies, including banks, have earnings to
pay for operational risk. And the calculation that gets us to $400 billion is
questionable and so complex that I am
not going to explain it here. Finally, most
of our operational risk assets stem from
Bear Stearns and WaMu subprime mortgage products that we don’t even offer
anymore. Tying up capital in perpetuity
– looking for shadows on the wall – is
probably not the best idea for fostering
growth in America.
• Comprehensive Capital Analysis Review.
I deeply believe in stress testing, but I do
have issues with CCAR. First, it consists
of only a single test (there are many
things that can go wrong that should
be stress tested) – which is unlikely to
prepare anyone (banks or regulators)
adequately. There is an arbitrariness
to a single test. Moreover, I don’t think
CCAR accurately represents what a loss
would look like in the nine quarters
after a Lehman-type event (remember
that in the nine quarters following the
actual Lehman collapse, JPMorgan Chase
earned $30 billion). One of the refrains
that we hear about CCAR results is they
show that most banks at the worst part
of the stress cycle can barely cover their
required capital. This is fundamentally
inaccurate. The CCAR test can give this
false impression because it requires
banks to do unnatural things (such as
continuing all stock buybacks – even
when it is completely obvious that
banks wouldn’t or couldn’t do this). As a
result, we don’t rely solely on CCAR, and
we stress test hundreds of scenarios a
month, preparing ourselves for circumstances far worse than CCAR stress.
While CCAR losses may exceed what
banks are likely to experience, they do
appropriately include benefits that banks
receive from being diversified and from
having healthy profit margins. And
CCAR is an effective built-in countercyclical buffer because its whole purpose
is to ensure adequate capital at the worst
point of a major stress event. Capital
requirements for GSIBs, however, are
completely different.
• GSIB capital requirements. My biggest
issue is with GSIB capital requirements, and since they may be added
to the CCAR stress test, they become
even more important. Most of the
factors used in GSIB requirements
are not risk-adjusted – and many of
the calculations have no fundamental
underpinning or logical justification.
Their methodology irrationally multiplies certain factors over and over, and
many of the facts are simply unjustified on any basis. For example, one
of the risks is called “substitutability,”
which is supposed to measure the risk
that we won’t be able to replace certain
services of a large bank that fails or
retrenches during a crisis. The specific
factors used to calculate this risk are
market share of equity and debt underwriting and market making. But when 
33
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
Lehman failed, no one had a problem
in replacing any of these activities.
For another example, American regulators simply doubled thresholds for
American banks (versus international
competition) and have never adjusted
them, as they were supposed to do, for
economic growth, for other new regulations like total loss absorbing capacity
and liquidity or for the fact that GSIB
banks have become a smaller part of
the financial system. Now regulators
are talking about adding GSIB requirements to CCAR, which is only logical if
the GSIB charge itself makes sense in
the first place. If GSIB regulation is to
become this important, it needs thorough justification.
Later in this letter I discuss some possible
adverse consequences to the U.S. financial
system because of the interplay between
these factors in a downturn. One comment
that we continue to hear is that U.S. banks
are now doing quite well despite evidence
that GSIB requirements are tougher on
U.S. banks than on foreign banks. But
that outperformance is not ordained from
above and may not always be the case. We
should calculate data the right way, and
U.S. banks, their employees, shareholders
and the communities they serve should not
be put at a permanent disadvantage.
Proper calibration of financial regulation
can enhance the growth and resiliency of
the U.S. economy, which actually reduces
systemic risk and helps banks safely serve
more clients.
4. We believe stock buybacks are an essential part of proper capital allocation but
secondary to long-term investing.
I have already noted that stock buybacks,
though sometimes misused, are an
important tool that businesses must have
to reallocate excess capital. To reiterate, this
should be done only after proper investments for the future have been considered.
A recent complaint is that companies,
partially due to tax reform, have used
their excess capital to buy back more
stock instead of investing in their business. While this is true, you should keep in
mind three things. First, as stock buybacks
increased in 2018, so did corporate capital
expenditures and research and development (R&D). In fact, contrary to popular
belief, capital expenditures as a percentage
of GDP are higher today than in the “good
old days” of the 1950s and 1960s. Second,
companies tend to buy back stock when
they don’t see a good use for capital in the
next year or two. We believe that as companies adjust to the new higher cash flows,
they will begin to reinvest more of that
money in the United States. The benefit of
tax reform is the long-term (multi-year)
cumulative effect of capital retained and
reinvested in the United States. And third,
the capital that was used to buy back stock
did not disappear – it was given to shareholders who then put it to a better and
higher use of their own choosing.
Here is one concluding comment on longterm investing: Many investors legitimately demand that companies think long
term and explain their strategies and policies. Meanwhile, these same investors, who
demand long-term thinking from companies, often invest in funds that are paid a
lot of money for how a stock performs in
one year. I hope these investors appreciate
the disconnect and hope they will consider
the pressures for short-term performance
they may have helped to create.

5. On the importance of the cloud and artificial intelligence, we are all in.
The power of the cloud is real.
We were a little slow in adopting the cloud,
for which I am partially responsible. My
early thinking about the cloud was that it
was just another term for outsourcing. I held
firm to the view, which is somewhat still
true, that we can run our own data centers,
networks and applications as efficiently as
anyone. But here’s the critical point: Cloud
capabilities are far more extensive, and
we are now full speed ahead. Let me cite a
couple of examples:
• The cloud gives us the ability to achieve
rapid scale and elasticity of computing
power exponentially beyond our own
capacity. This will be especially relevant as
we scale up our artificial intelligence efforts.
• The cloud platform is agile and flexible.
It offers access to data sets, advanced
analytics and machine learning capabilities beyond our own. It increases developers’ effectiveness by multiples – you
can almost “click and drop” new elements
into existing programs as opposed to
writing extensive new code. For instance,
adding databases and/or machine
learning to an application can be done
almost instantaneously. And certain
tasks, such as testing code and provisioning compute power, are automated.
• The cloud provides a software development experience that is frictionless and
allows our engineers to prototype quickly
and learn fast, as well as increase the
speed of delivering new capabilities to our
customers and clients.
It is important to note that the cloud has
matured to the point where it can meet the
high expectations that are set by large enterprises that have fairly intense demands
around security, audit procedures, access to
systems, cyber security and business resiliency.
We will be rapidly “refactoring” most of our
applications to take full advantage of cloud
computing. We then can decide whether it is
more advantageous to run our applications
on the external cloud or the internal cloud
(the internal cloud will have many of the
benefits of the external cloud’s scalable and
efficient platforms).
One final but key issue: Agile platforms and
cloud capabilities not only allow you to do
things much faster but also enable you to
organize teams differently. You can create
smaller teams of five to 20 people who can
be continually reimagining, reinventing and
rolling out new products and services in a
few days instead of months.
The power of artificial intelligence and machine
learning is real.
These technologies already are helping us
reduce risk and fraud, upgrade customer
service, improve underwriting and enhance
marketing across the firm. And this is just
the beginning. As our management teams
get better at understanding the power of AI
and machine learning, these tools are rapidly
being deployed across virtually everything we
do. We can also use artificial intelligence to
try to achieve certain desired outcomes, such
as making mortgages even more available to
minorities. A few examples will suffice:
• In the Corporate & Investment Bank,
DeepX leverages machine learning to
assist our equities algorithms globally to
execute transactions across 1,300 stocks a
day, and this total is rising as we roll out
DeepX to new countries.
• Across our company, we will be deploying
virtual assistants (robots driven by artificial intelligence) to handle tasks such as
maintaining internal help desks, tracking
down errors and routing inquiries.
• In Consumer Marketing, we are better
able to customize insights and offerings
for individual customers, based on, for
example, their ability to save or invest,
their travel preferences or the availability
of discounts on brands they like.
• Technological solutions help us do better
underwriting, expediting the mortgage or
automobile loan approval process, letting 
35
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
the customer accept the loan in a couple
of clicks and then start shopping for a
home or car.
• In our Consumer Operations, we are using
AI and machine learning techniques for
ATM cash management to optimize cash
in devices, reduce the cost of reloads and
schedule ATM maintenance.
• And our initial results from machine
learning fraud applications are expected
to drive approximately $150 million of
annual benefits and countless efficiencies.
For example, machine learning is helping
to deliver a better customer experience
while also prioritizing safety at the point of
sale, where fraud losses have been reduced
significantly, with automated decisions
on transactions made in milliseconds.
We are now able to approve 1 million
additional good customers (who would
have been declined for potential fraud)
and also decline approximately 1 million
additional fraudsters (who would have
been approved). Machine learning will
also curtail check fraud losses by analyzing
signatures, payee names and check features
in real time.
• Over time, AI will also dramatically
improve Anti-Money Laundering/Bank
Secrecy Act protocols and processes as well
as other complex compliance requirements.
We will try to retrain and redeploy our workforce
as AI reduces certain types of jobs.
We are evaluating all of our jobs to determine which are most susceptible to being
lost through AI. We will plan ahead so we
can retrain or deploy our employees both
for other roles inside the company and, if
necessary, outside the company.
The combined power of virtually unlimited
computing strength, AI applied to almost
anything and the ability to use vast sets
of data and rapidly change applications
is extraordinary – we have only begun to
take advantage of the opportunities for the
company and for our customers.
6. We remain devoted and diligent to protect privacy and stay cyber safe — we will do what
it takes.
The threat of cyber security may very well be the
biggest threat to the U.S. financial system.
I have written in previous letters about the
enormous effort and resources we dedicate to protect ourselves and our clients
– we spend nearly $600 million a year on
these efforts and have more than 3,000
employees deployed to this mission in some
way. Indirectly, we also spend a lot of time
and effort trying to protect our company in
different ways as part of the ordinary course
of running the business. But the financial
system is interconnected, and adversaries are
smart and relentless – so we must continue
to be vigilant. The good news is that the
industry (plus many other industries), along
with the full power of the federal government, is increasingly being mobilized to
combat this threat.
The issues around privacy are real.
We have spoken frequently in the past about
the importance of safeguarding the privacy
of our customers. We already do this extensively, and, in fact, we are inventing new
products to make it easier for our customers
to understand where we send their data
(with their permission), as well as how to
change or restrict what we do with that data.
New laws in Europe stipulate that consumers
should be able to see what data companies
have on file about them and to correct or
delete this information if they choose. These
are the right principles, but they are very
complex to execute. It is imperative that the
U.S. government thoughtfully design policies
to protect its consumers and that these policies be national versus state-specific. Different 
36
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
state laws around privacy rules would create
a virtually impossible legal, compliance and
regulatory-monitoring situation.
But maybe the most crucial privacy issue of
all relates to protecting our democracy. Our
First Amendment rights do not extend to
foreign governments, entities or individuals.
The openness of the internet means that
trolls, foreign governments and others are
aggressively using social media and other
platforms to confuse and distort information.
They should not be allowed to secretly or
dishonestly advertise or even promote ideas
on media and social networks. We believe
there are ways to address this, and we will be
talking more about this issue in the future.
7. We know there are risks on the horizon that will eventually demand our attention.
In spite of all the uncertainty, the U.S.
economy continues to grow in 2019, albeit
more slowly than in 2018. Employment and
wages are going up, inflation is moderate,
financial markets are healthy, and consumer
and business confidence remains strong,
although down from all-time highs. The
consumer balance sheet and credit are in
rather good shape, and housing, though not
particularly strong, is in short supply in
many U.S. cities, which should eventually
be a tailwind. Before I review some of the
serious and possibly increasing risks that
we may confront in the years ahead, I do
want to review what happened in the fourth
quarter of 2018.
The fourth quarter of 2018 might be a harbinger
of things to come.
Going into the final months of last year, optimism about the global economy prevailed,
and this was reflected in the stock and
bond markets. But in the fourth quarter,
growth slowed in Germany; Italy repudiated
European Union rules; Brexit uncertainty
remained; and fear spiked around America’s trade issues with China. Among other
geopolitical tensions, the U.S. government
shutdown began. In addition, more questions
arose about interest rate increases in the
United States and the effect of the reversal of
unprecedented quantitative easing, particularly in this country. These issues, which
reduced growth forecasts and increased
uncertainty, should legitimately cause stock
prices to drop and bond spreads to increase.
However, stock markets fell 20%, investment
grade bond spreads gapped out by 36% and
certain markets (like initial public offerings
and high yield) virtually closed down. Even
at the time, these large swings seemed to
be an overreaction, but they highlight two
critical issues. One, which we never forget, is
that investor sentiment can veer widely from
optimism to pessimism based on little fundamental change. And second, for the fourth
or fifth time in this recovery, there were
excessive moves in the market with rapidly
increasing volatility accompanied by steep
drops in liquidity.
Market reactions do not always accurately
reflect the real economy, and, therefore, policymakers and even companies should not
overreact to them. But they do reflect market
participant views of changing probabilities
and possibilities of economic outcomes.
Thus, policymakers (and banks), particularly
the Fed, must necessarily (because they need
to think forward) take an assessment of these
issues into account. With this backdrop, I
will discuss some of the serious issues on
people’s minds (with more on liquidity later).
There are legitimate concerns around China’s
economy (in addition to trade), but they are
manageable.
To fully understand China, you have to do
a fair assessment of all of its strengths and
weaknesses. Over the last 40 years, China has
done a highly effective job of getting itself
to this point of economic development, but
in the next 40 years, the country will have
to confront serious issues. The Chinese lack
enough food, water and energy; corruption
continues to be a problem; state-owned 
37
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
enterprises are often inefficient; corporate
and government debt levels are growing
rapidly; financial markets lack depth, transparency and adequate rule of law; and Asia
is a very complex part of the world geopolitically speaking. Just as important, not enough
people participate in the nation’s political
system. Chinese leadership is well aware of
these issues and talks about many of them
quite openly. I say none of this to be negative about China (indeed, I have enormous
respect for what the Chinese have accomplished in the economic realm) but just to
give a balanced view. And in spite of these
difficulties, we believe that China is well on
its way to becoming a fully developed nation,
though the future will probably entail more
uncertainty and moments of slower growth
(like the rest of us) than in the past.
Disruption of trade is another risk for
China. The United States’ trade issues with
China are substantial and real. They include
the theft or forced transfer of intellectual
property; lack of bilateral investment rights,
giving ownership or control of investments;
onerous non-tariff barriers; unfair subsidies
or benefits for state-owned enterprises; and
the lack of rapid enforcement of any disagreements. The U.S. position is supported, though
in an uncoordinated way, by our Japanese
and European allies. We should only expect
China to do what is in its own self-interest,
but we believe that it should and will agree
to some of the United States’ trade demands
because, ultimately, the changes will create
a stronger Chinese economy. We should
also point out that over the last 30 years,
the Chinese have been on a high-speed path
that includes increasing transparency and
economic reform, and while the momentum
slows down periodically, they have continued
relentlessly on that path. We believe the odds
are high that a fair trade deal will eventually
be worked out – but if not, there could be
serious repercussions.
China can deal with many serious situations because, unlike developed democratic
nations, it can both macromanage and
micromanage its economy and move very
fast. Government officials can pull, in a coordinated way, fiscal, monetary and industrial
policy levers to maintain the growth and
employment they want, and they have the
control and wherewithal to do it. That being
said, the American public should understand
that China does not have a straight road to
becoming the dominant economic power.
The nation simply has too much to overcome
in the foreseeable future. If China and the
United States can maintain a healthy strategic
and economic relationship (and that should
be our goal), it could greatly benefit both
countries – as well as the rest of the world.
Debt levels are increasing around the world —
although this debt is mitigated because much
of it is sovereign debt, which is different from
corporate and consumer debt.
If countries essentially owe debt to themselves, not to creditors outside their country,
they can generally manage their debt
(America’s total debt to GDP is just about
80%, while Japan’s is approaching 200%).
Such debt is not necessarily a good thing
because it can be politically destabilizing and
overcomplicate policymaking; however, it
is generally manageable because if a nation
owes money to itself, it is essentially reallocating its income across various interest
groups within the country. If the country
can continue to grow, it can still create more
income for its citizens.
America’s debt level is rapidly increasing
but is not at the danger level. While America
does owe in excess of $6 trillion (essentially
40% of its publicly held debt) to creditors
outside the country, U.S. companies and
investors hold more than $25 trillion in total
claims on foreigners, including more than
$12 trillion of foreign portfolio holdings,
and the U.S. economy is worth more than
$100 trillion. So we earn more on foreign
assets than we pay to foreign creditors. This
is not a major issue. However, our country’s
debt level over the next 30 years will start
to increase exponentially, and at a certain
point, this could cause concern in global
capital markets. We have time to address this
problem, but we should start to deal with the
issue well before it becomes a crisis. 
38
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
People also point to emerging market debt –
both corporate and sovereign – as a potential
issue, but the emerging markets, both countries and companies, are much bigger and
stronger than they were in the past. They
have more foreign exchange reserves and
generally more effective risk management of
currency and interest rate mismatches.
Leveraged lending is increasing, particularly
through shadow banks.
Total leveraged lending in the United
States is approximately $2.3 trillion. About
25% of the loans are owned by banks, the
majority in more senior positions, and the
remaining 75% are owned by shadow banks
or non-banks. Deconstructing that number a
bit, about $1.8 trillion is in U.S. institutional
leverage term loans – approximately 30%
of which are owned by banks. We estimate
that approximately $500 billion of direct
loans are owned exclusively by non-banks.
While leveraged lending is a growing issue
and one that we are monitoring, we don’t
think this is yet of the size or quality to cause
systemic issues in the financial system. This
does not mean it won’t create some issues.
When things get bad, invariably prices drop
dramatically, certain types of high-yield debt
cannot be refinanced, etc. – but at this level,
it is still a manageable issue.
There are growing geopolitical tensions — with
less certainty around American global leadership.
Geopolitical tensions are always there – just
reading the newspaper in any week in any
year since World War II would make anyone
pretty worried. But it does appear that geopolitical tensions are growing. Let me mention a
few: Russian aggression, Middle East conflicts,
Venezuela, North Korea, Iran, Turkey, Brexit
and European politics generally.
It’s always difficult to understand the effect
of geopolitical uncertainty. But it is now
heightened due to uncertainty around how
the United States intends to exercise global
leadership. This uncertainty may very well
be the biggest new unknown factor affecting
critical geopolitical and economic issues.
The chance of bad policy errors is increasing.
In this risk section and in the next section
on public policy, I feel compelled to emphasize an obvious point: Bad public policy is
a major risk. It could be central banks and
monetary policy, trade snafus or simply deep
political gridlock in an increasingly complex
world – but bad policymaking is definitely
an increasing risk for the global economy.
The confusion and uncertainty around liquidity
are causing some legitimate concerns.
Several times in the last few years, including
in the fourth quarter of 2018, markets
exhibited rapid losses of liquidity, although
fortunately, and importantly, the markets
recovered in all cases – but that was in the
context of a good environment. The ongoing
debate around liquidity and short-term losses
of liquidity in the market is an important
one. We consider it in two ways: traditional
liquidity and macro liquidity.
• Traditional liquidity. I call it micro liquidity
here, and it generally refers to the width of
the bid-ask spread, as well as the size and
speed with which securities can be bought
or sold without dramatically affecting
their price. There is no question that some
micro liquidity is more constrained than
in the past due to bank capital, liquidity
and Volcker Rule requirements. In addition, high-frequency traders generally
create some intraday liquidity (within a
day), though even this is unreliable in a
downturn. Because they rarely take positions interday (day to day), traders do not
create real liquidity, but my view is that
they increase the volatility of liquidity
over time. There is no question that rules
and regulations also cause unwanted and
unnecessary distortions in money market
vehicles, such as repos and swaps, particularly at quarter-end.
If you look at liquidity – from before the
financial crisis to today – in fairly liquid
markets like Treasuries, swaps and equities, there is a noticeable difference. In
good markets, liquidity is essentially high
and is almost at the same level today as it 
39
II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
was before the crisis. But when markets
became volatile in the last several years,
liquidity dropped much further and faster
than it did before the crisis. It is important
to remember that this happened in good
times. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect
that what we have been experiencing is
now the new normal of liquidity – and
that we should be prepared for it to be
even worse in truly difficult times.
• Macro liquidity. This describes a broader
view of financial conditions. For example,
is it easy to borrow and lend? Are banks
able to increase their lending? Is the cost of
borrowing going up? Is the Fed adding or
reducing liquidity in the system (essentially
by buying or selling Treasuries)? There is
no doubt that new regulations, particularly
bank liquidity requirements, dramatically
reduce the ability of the Fed to increase
bank lending today by shoring up bank
reserves. In the old days, the central bank
could effectively create excess reserves by
buying Treasuries. These excess reserves
were lendable by the bank. Today, such
reserves are often not lendable due to new
liquidity rules. So bank lending as a function of deposits is, in effect, permanently
reduced. The notion of “money velocity”
and in fact the transmission of monetary
policy are, therefore, different from the
past, and it is hard to calculate the full
effect of all these changes. It is extremely
difficult for us, and probably even for the
Fed, to know when and at what level the
removal of cash (liquidity) from the system
starts to significantly affect macro or micro
liquidity. We will, however, probably know
it when we see it.
There may be too much certainty that growth will
be slow and inflation subdued.
There is still global growth, and employment and wages continue to go up. However,
this has been a very slow recovery, and it is
possible that the “normal” increase of inflation late in the cycle, due to wage demands
and limited supply, can still happen. We
don’t see it today, but I would not rule it out.
In addition, 10-year bond spreads have been
suppressed in some way by the extreme
quantitative easing around the world. If that
ever reverses in a material way, how could
it not have an effect on the 10-year bond?
Finally, I would not look at the yield curve
and its potential inversion as giving the same
signals as in the past. There has simply been
too much interference in the global markets
by central banks and regulators to understand its full effect on the yield curve.
Expect banks to be far more constrained going
into the next real downturn.
Today is nothing like 2008. There are fewer
leveraged financial assets in the system
now than a decade ago. In 2008, huge losses
in the mortgage market forced consumers
and companies to sell assets acquired by
borrowing. Fundamentally, market panic
ensued. Now there is far less borrowing
against assets, and it is unlikely that there
will be a lot of forced selling as a result.
However, keep in mind that it is still possible
for investors to sell lots of assets if any form
of market panic takes place.
When the next real downturn begins, banks
will be constrained – both psychologically
and by new regulations – from lending freely
into the marketplace, as many of us did in
2008 and 2009. New regulations mean that
banks will have to maintain more liquidity
going into a downturn, be prepared for the
impacts of even tougher stress tests and
hold more capital because capital requirements are even more procyclical than in the
past. Effectively, some new rules will force
capital to the sidelines just when it might
be needed most by clients and the markets.
For example, in the next financial crisis,
JPMorgan Chase will simply be unable to
take some of the actions we took in 2008, as
described in the sidebar on pages 27-28.
The Fed is still quite powerful and retains
numerous tools to deal with many of the issues
described above.
There is excessive focus on what the Fed says
and does in the short term. The Fed appropriately, and by necessity, needs to be data
dependent – how could it be otherwise? And,
of course, while proper policy requires Fed

II. COMMENTS ON CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES
officials to constantly think about the future
(though it does not require them to make
specific forecasts public), they can’t know
what the future holds with any certainty. But
they are deeply knowledgeable, flexible and
appropriately willing to change their minds.
And, counter to what you often hear today,
they retain a large number of tools at their
disposal. They can change short-term rates at
will and, in fact, can effect change on longer
term rates if they want. With a few simple
words, they can change the future expectations of the interest rate curve. They can buy
or finance an extraordinary amount of assets,
and they can revise regulations, if necessary,
to improve liquidity or enhance lending.
They can often, simply by asking, get banks
to take certain actions that they want. It is a
mistake to think that they don’t have significant tools at their disposal.
Of course, we hyper-focus on today’s problems, and they often overshadow the progress we are making across the globe. We
should not overlook the positive signs. In
addition to the strong U.S. economy, the
world is still growing, trade issues may be
properly resolved and Brazil, among others,
has turned the corner economically.
If a downturn starts and leads to darker
scenarios, we will be prepared, and we also
believe the U.S. government will eventually
respond adequately.
8. We are prepared for — though we are not predicting — a recession.
The key point here is that a fairly healthy
U.S. economy will be confronting a wide
variety of issues in 2020 and 2021. It’s hard
to look at all the issues facing the world and
not think that the range of possible outcomes
is broader and that the odds of bad outcomes
might be increasing. And certain factors, like
confidence, which we know is important, can
be easily damaged by bad policy, unexpected
events or even high market volatility. The
next recession may not resemble prior recessions. Next time, the cause may be just the
cumulative effect of negative factors – the
proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.
We are always prepared to deal with the next
recession.
We generally do not spend a lot of time
guessing about when the next recession will
be – we manage our business knowing that
there will be cycles.
First and foremost, we will continue to serve
our clients. From the prior parts of this
letter, you can see that we continued to make
responsible loans to our clients during and
after the Great Recession when they needed
us most – and we will do that again. We will
not stop investing in our future, investing in
technology or building new branches. We will
continue to make markets for our clients. We
will not overreact to the credit cycle.
We will mitigate risk. We may reduce risk
by taking on fewer new clients or by syndicating or hedging risk. And we may reduce
risk by managing our portfolio of securities and loans unrelated to clients. We will
exercise more of our muscle in terms of
managing expenses, monitoring headcount
and creating more efficiencies. We will have
special credit teams, created in advance, to
deal with any problematic credits.
Finally, we will be seeking out new ways
to grow and compete. Our experience is
that recessions do create opportunities for
healthy companies to enhance their franchises generally by serving clients where
other companies cannot.
41
There are many critical issues roiling the
United States and other countries around
the world today – just to name a few:
capitalism versus other economic systems,
the role of business in our society, how the
United States intends to exercise global
leadership, income inequality, equal opportunity, access to healthcare, immigration
and diversity. Many people have lost faith
in government’s ability to solve these and
other problems. In fact, almost all institutions – governments, schools, unions,
media and businesses – have lost credibility
in the eyes of the public. In the meantime,
many of these problems have been around
for a long time and are not aging well. Politics is increasingly divisive, and a number
of policies are not working. This state of
affairs is unlikely to get better without thorough diagnosis, thoughtful policy solutions
and a commitment to a common purpose.
1. The American Dream is alive — but fraying for many.
Before I talk about our problems, I think it’s
important to put any negatives in context, so
first a paean to our nation. America is still
the most prosperous nation the world has
ever seen. We are blessed with the natural
gifts of land; all the food, water and energy
we need; the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as
natural borders; and wonderful neighbors
in Canada and Mexico. And we are blessed
with the extraordinary gifts from our
Founding Fathers, which are still unequaled:
freedom of speech, freedom of religion,
freedom of enterprise, and the promise of
equality and opportunity. These gifts have
led to the most dynamic economy the world
has ever seen, nurturing vibrant businesses
large and small, exceptional universities, and
a welcoming environment for innovation,
science and technology. America was an idea
borne on principles, not based upon historical relationships and tribal politics. It has
and will continue to be a beacon of hope for
the world and a magnet for the world’s best
and brightest.
Of course, America has always had its flaws.
Some of its more recent issues center on
income inequality, stagnant wages, lack of
equal opportunity, immigration and lack
of access to healthcare. I make it a practice when hearing complaints to strive to
understand where people might be right
or partially right instead of rejecting or
accepting their views reflexively.
III. PUBLIC POLICY
In this section, I attempt to analyze and
offer some views on what has caused
this situation and then suggest some
solutions. Neither the diagnoses nor the
proposed cures are purely my own. These
issues have been studied intensively by
many people with deep knowledge. And
given the space and other constraints of
this letter, I may be about to violate the
Einstein maxim, which I love: “Everything
should be made as simple as possible, but
not simpler.” One of the main points I am
trying to make is that when you step back
and take a comprehensive multi-year view,
looking at the situation in its totality, it
is the cumulative effect of many of our
policies that has created many of our problems. And whatever the solutions, I think
they are unlikely to be achieved by government alone – civil society and business
need to be part of the equation. To start,
we must understand our problems.
42
III. PUBLIC POLICY
Middle class incomes have been stagnant
for years. Income inequality has gotten
worse. Forty percent of American workers
earn less than $15 an hour, and about 5%
of full-time American workers earn the
minimum wage or less, which is certainly
not a living wage. In addition, 40% of
Americans don’t have $400 to deal with
unexpected expenses, such as medical
bills or car repairs. More than 28 million
Americans don’t have medical insurance
at all. And, surprisingly, 25% of those
eligible for various types of federal assistance programs don’t get any help. No
one can claim that the promise of equal
opportunity is being offered to all Americans through our education systems, nor
are those who have run afoul of our justice
system getting the second chance that
many of them deserve. And we have been
debating immigration reform for 30 years.
Simply put, the social needs of far too
many of our citizens are not being met.
Over the last 10 years, the U.S. economy has
grown cumulatively about 20%. While this
may sound impressive, it must be put into
context: After a sharp downturn, economic
growth would have been 40% over 10 years
in a normal recovery. Twenty percent more
growth would have added $4 trillion to
GDP, which certainly would have driven
wages higher and given us the wherewithal
to broadly build a better country. Key
questions that keep arising – and remain
unanswered are: Why have productivity
and economic growth been so anemic?
And why have income inequality and so
many other things gotten worse? Included
among the common explanations is that
“secular stagnation” is the new normal. I’ve
also heard blame placed on institutional
greed and “short-termism,” bad corporate
governance, job displacement from new
technologies, immigration or trade and a
lack of new productivity-enhancing technology. Another common refrain is that
capitalism and free enterprise have failed.
As you’ll see, I think some of these arguments miss the mark.
2. We must have a proper diagnosis of our problems — the issues are real and serious —
if we want to have the proper prescription that leads to workable solutions.
Slogans are not policy, and, though simple
and sometimes virtuous-sounding, they often
lead to policies that fail. Well-intentioned but
poorly designed policies generally have large
and unintended negative consequences. Policy
should always be extremely well-designed.
In my view, too often we don’t perform the
deep analysis required to fully understand
our problems. One of the reasons is that we
often have too short term an orientation;
i.e., looking at how things have changed
year-over-year or even quarter-over-quarter.
We frequently fail to look at trends over a
multi-year period or over decades – we miss
the forest for the trees. It’s also important to
point out that many economic models that
are used to design policy have a hard time
incorporating or accounting for the effect of
certain factors that can be pivotal but are too
complex or qualitative to model.
I have tried to come up with a list of critical
factors that greatly affect the health of an
economy over many years (such as education, infrastructure, healthcare, etc.). The
list is below, and when you look at how we
have performed in these areas, it’s rather
condemning. Our shortcomings in these
areas clearly have impeded the prosperity
of the U.S. economy and have failed many
of our fellow citizens over the past two
decades or so. 
43
Our problems: What’s holding back our nation’s productivity and
economic growth and reducing opportunity
INEFFECTIVE AND OUT-OF-TOUCH
EDUCATION SYSTEMS
Many of our high schools, vocational schools and community
colleges do not properly prepare today’s younger generation
for available professional-level jobs, many of which pay a
multiple of the minimum wage. We used to be among the best
in the world at training our workforce for good jobs, but now
we are falling short. This is a huge reason for both inequality
and lack of opportunity. Our inner-city high schools are failing
their communities and are leaving too many behind. In some
inner-city schools, fewer than 60% of students graduate, and
of those who do, a significant number are not prepared for
employment and are often relegated to a life of poverty.
Proper training and retraining would also help in our rapidly
changing technological world. Finally, skills training has
become increasingly important over time, and the negligence
of our education systems to be responsive to employers’
current needs has to have reduced GDP growth.
SOARING HEALTHCARE COSTS
These now represent almost 20% of GDP — more than twice the
cost per person compared with most developed nations. While
we have some of the best healthcare in the world, our outcomes
are not twice as good as those of the rest of the world. Some
studies say that gains in life expectancy in the last 50 years were
a significant contributor to U.S. national wealth (and health),
possibly equal to half of GDP growth, as people were healthier
and lived longer, which generally improved the quality of the
labor force and productivity. This may no longer be true. Obesity
costs our country $1.4 trillion a year because it drives so many
illnesses (i.e., heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke and
depression). Even worse, 70% of today’s youth (ages 17–24) are
not eligible for military service, essentially due to poor academic
skills (basic reading and writing) or health issues (often obesity
or diabetes). And out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for the
average American have skyrocketed over the last 20 years,
causing huge anxiety, particularly for low-income families who
have been hit with the highest increases in healthcare costs.
EXCESSIVE REGULATION AND
BUREAUCRACY
Excessive regulation for both large and small companies
has reduced growth and business formation without
making the economic system safer or better. The ease of
starting a business in the United States has worsened, and
both small business formation and employment growth
have dropped to the lowest rates in 30 years. By some
estimates, approximately $2 trillion is spent on federal
regulations annually, which is about $15,000 per household. We need good regulations, and we have to get better
at effectively implementing them — accomplishing the
desired good outcomes — while minimizing unnecessary
costs and bad unintended consequences.
INABILITY TO PLAN AND BUILD
INFRASTRUCTURE
It took eight years to get a man to the moon (from idea to
completion), but it now can take a decade to simply get the
permits to build a bridge or a new solar field. The country that
used to have the best infrastructure on the planet by most
measures is now not even ranked among the top 20 developed
nations, according to the World Economic Forum’s Basic
Requirement Index, which reflects infrastructure along with
other criteria. We are falling behind on airports, bridges,
water, highways, aviation and more. One study examined the
effect of poor infrastructure on efficiency (for example, poorly
constructed highways, congested airports with antiquated air
traffic control systems, aging electrical grids and old water
pipes) and concluded this could all be costing us more than
$200 billion a year. Philip K. Howard, who does some of the
best academic work on America’s infrastructure, estimates it
would cost $4 trillion to fix our aging infrastructure — and this
is less than it would cost not to fix it. In fact, a recent study by
Business Roundtable found that every dollar spent restoring
our infrastructure system to good repair and expanding its
capacity would produce nearly $4 in economic benefits. What
happened to that “can-do” nation of ours?
44
PREVIOUSLY UNCOMPETITIVE TAX
SYSTEM FOR BUSINESS
Over the last 20 years, as the world reduced its tax rates,
America did not. Our previous tax code was increasingly
uncompetitive, overly complex and loaded with special-interest
provisions that created winners and losers. This was driving
down capital investment in the United States and giving an
advantage to foreign companies, thereby reducing productivity
and causing wages to remain stagnant. The good news is the
recent changes in the U.S. tax system include many of the key
ingredients to fuel economic expansion: a business tax rate that
will make the United States competitive around the world along
with provisions to free U.S. companies to bring back profits
earned overseas.
CAPRICIOUS AND WASTEFUL
LITIGATION SYSTEM
Our litigation system now costs 1.6% of GDP, 1% more than
what it costs in the average OECD (Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development) nation.
FRUSTRATING IMMIGRATION
POLICIES AND REFORM
Forty percent of foreign students who receive advanced
degrees in science, technology and math (300,000 students
annually) have no legal way of staying here, although many
would choose to do so. Most students from countries outside
the United States pay full freight to attend our universities,
but many are forced to take the skills they learned here back
home. From my vantage point, that means one of our largest
exports is brainpower. We need more thoughtful, merit-based
immigration policies. In addition, most Americans would like a
permanent solution to DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals) and a path to legal status for law-abiding, tax-paying
undocumented immigrants — this is tearing the body politic
apart. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the failure to
pass immigration reform earlier this decade is costing us 0.3%
of GDP a year.
INEFFICIENT MORTGAGE MARKETS
The inability to reform mortgage markets has dramatically
reduced mortgage availability. In fact, our analysis shows that,
conservatively, more than $1 trillion in additional mortgage loans
might have been made over a five-year period had we reformed
our mortgage system. J.P. Morgan analysis indicates that the cost
of not reforming the mortgage markets could be as high as 0.2%
of GDP a year.
LACK OF PROPER FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT BUDGETING
AND PLANNING
This inevitably leads to waste, inefficiency and constraints on
multi-year planning. One striking example: It may cost the
military at least 20% of its spending power when budgets are
not approved on time and continuous spending resolutions are
imposed. And we don’t do some basic things well, like account
for loans and guarantees properly and demand appropriate
funding of public pension plans.
STUDENT LENDING (AND DEBT)
Irrational student lending, soaring college costs and the burden of
student loans have become a significant issue. The impact of
student debt is now affecting mortgage credit and household
formation — a $1,000 increase in student debt reduces subsequent
homeownership rates by 1.8%. Recent research shows that the
burdens of student debt are now starting to affect the economy.
DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN LABOR
FORCE PARTICIPATION
Wages for low-skilled work are no longer a living wage — the
incentives to start work have been declining over time. Add to
this the education issues already mentioned above. Two other
contributing factors are that many former felons have a hard
time getting jobs, and an estimated 2 million Americans are
currently addicted to opioids (in 2017, a staggering 48,000
Americans died because of opioid overdoses). Some studies
show that addiction is one of the major reasons why many men
ages 25–54 are permanently out of work. 
45
III. PUBLIC POLICY
It is hard to look at these issues in their
totality and not conclude that they have a
significant negative effect on the great American economic engine. My view is if you add
it all up, this dysfunction could easily have
been a 1% drag on our growth rate. Before I
talk about some ideas to address these issues,
I would like to discuss one major debate
currently in the echo chamber.
Is capitalism to blame? Is socialism better?
There is no question that capitalism has been
the most successful economic system the
world has ever seen. It has helped lift billions
of people out of poverty, and it has helped
enhance the wealth, health and education of
people around the world. Capitalism enables
competition, innovation and choice.
This is not to say that capitalism does not
have flaws, that it isn’t leaving people behind
and that it shouldn’t be improved. It’s essential to have a strong social safety net – and all
countries should be striving for continuous
improvement in regulations as well as social
and welfare conditions.
Many countries are called social democracies, and they successfully combine market
economies with strong social safety nets.
This is completely different from traditional
socialism. In a traditional socialist system,
the government controls the means of
production and decides what to produce and
in what quantities, and, often, how and where
the citizens work rather than leaving those
decisions in the hands of the private sector.
When governments control companies,
economic assets (companies, lenders and
so on) over time are used to further political interests – leading to inefficient companies and markets, enormous favoritism and
corruption. As Margaret Thatcher said, “The
problem with socialism is that eventually you
run out of other people’s money.” Socialism
inevitably produces stagnation, corruption
and often worse – such as authoritarian
government officials who often have an
increasing ability to interfere with both the
economy and individual lives – which they
frequently do to maintain power. This would
be as much a disaster for our country as it has
been in the other places it’s been tried.
I am not an advocate for unregulated, unvarnished, free-for-all capitalism. (Few people I
know are.) But we shouldn’t forget that true
freedom and free enterprise (capitalism) are,
at some point, inexorably linked.
Successful economies will create large, successful
companies.
Show me a country without any large,
successful companies, and I will show you
an unsuccessful country – with too few
jobs and not enough opportunity as an
outcome. And no country would be better
off without its large, successful companies in
addition to its midsized and small companies. Private enterprise is the true engine of
growth in any country. Approximately 150
million people work in the United States:
130 million work in private enterprise and
only 20 million people in government. As
I pointed out earlier in this letter, large,
successful companies generally provide
good wages, even at the starting level, as
well as insurance for employees and their
families, retirement plans, training and
other benefits. Companies in a free enterprise system drive innovation through
capital investments and R&D; they are huge
supporters of communities; and they often
are at the forefront of social policy. Are they
the reason for all of society’s ills? Absolutely
not. However, in many ways and without ill
intent, many companies were able to avoid –
almost literally drive by – many of society’s
problems. Now they are being called upon to
do more – and they should. 
46
III. PUBLIC POLICY
We need to set aside partisan politics.
None of these issues is exclusively owned
by Democrats or Republicans. To the
contrary, it is clear that partisan politics is
stopping collaborative policy from being
implemented, particularly at the federal
level. This is not some special economic
malaise we are in. This is about our society.
We are unwilling to compromise. We are
unwilling or unable to create good policy
based on deep analytics. And our government is unable to reorganize and keep pace
in the new world. Plain and simple, this is a
collective failure to put the needs of society
ahead of our personal, parochial and
partisan interests. If we do not fix these
problems, America’s moral, economic and
military dominance may cease to exist.
In my view, we need a Marshall Plan for
America. To do this, Democrats have to
acknowledge that many of the things that
have been done as a nation – often in
the name of good – have sometimes not
worked and need to be modified. Throwing
money at problems does not always work.
Recently, a report showed that the federal
government wasted nearly $1 billion on
charter schools due to mismanagement
and lack of adequate oversight – this was
money intended to help children. Democrats should acknowledge Republicans’
legitimate concerns that sending money
to Washington tends to be simply seen as
waste, ultimately offering little value to
local communities. Republicans need to
acknowledge that America should and can
afford to provide a proper safety net for
our elderly, our sick and our poor, as well as
help create an environment that generates
more opportunities and more income for
more Americans. And if we can demonstrate that we are spending money wisely,
we should spend more – think infrastructure and education funding. And that
may very well mean taxing the wealthy
more. If that happens, the wealthy should
remember that if we improve our society
and our economy, then they, in effect, are
among the main winners.
Our nation requires strong political
leaders to develop good, thoughtful policies, use their political skills to determine
what is doable and exercise their leadership skills to lead people toward commonsense solutions.
We need to set aside our narrow self-interest.
We live in an increasingly complex world
where companies, governments, unions
and special interest groups vie for time,
attention and favorable circumstances for
their respective institutions. While it is a
constitutional right to petition our government, and many organizations legitimately
fight for the interests of their constituents,
we all may have become too self-interested. I fear that this self-interest is part of
what is destroying the glue that holds our
society together. We all share a collective
responsibility to improve our country.
I would like to give a few examples, which
represent the tip of the iceberg (it would
be easy to come up with thousands more).
• Governments, both federal and state,
fight to keep military bases open that
we don’t need and Veterans Affairs
hospitals that are broken – making the
military more costly and less effective.
Our shortcomings are not just about
inefficiencies; they border on immoral.
In an incredibly depressing story,
former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates
describes how Congress took years
longer than it should have to approve
the building of U.S. Army personnel
3. All these issues are fixable, but that will happen only if we set aside partisan politics and
narrow self-interest — our country must come first.
47
III. PUBLIC POLICY
carriers that we needed in Iraq and
Afghanistan to protect our soldiers from
improvised explosive devices. While
we dallied, many of our soldiers died or
received terrible lifelong injuries.
Five states (California, Connecticut,
Illinois, New Jersey and New York) fight
for unlimited state and local tax deductions because those five states reap 46%
of the benefit – even worse, knowing
that over 80% of the benefits from
these deductions go to people who earn
more than $320,000 a year.
• Businesses are equally guilty here.
Just start digging through the tax code
– buried in there are an extraordinary number of loopholes, credits and
exemptions that aren’t about competitiveness or good tax policy. Suffice it to
say, industry gets its share of tax breaks
and forms of protection from legitimate competition. I could add hospitals,
schools and unions to this list – none of
our institutions is blameless.
While leaders obviously fight for their
institutions, we all need to be able to
advocate for policies that are good for
our organizations without being bad for
our country. And as a general matter, we,
as citizens, should support policies that
are good for our country even if they
may not be good for us individually. For
too long, too many have fought to use
regulation and legislation to further their
interests without appropriate regard for
the needs of the country.
4. Governments must be better and more effective — we cannot succeed without their help.
The rest of us could do a better job, too.
The U.S. federal government is becoming
less relevant to what is going on in people’s
lives. People have generally lost faith in the
ability of institutions to deliver on their
mission and meet societal needs. They are
demanding change, and we must recognize
that change is needed. We need dramatic
reform of our global and federal institutions and how we attack our biggest societal challenges. There are signs of progress,
particularly in how local governments are
starting to attack pressing problems – the
ones that directly affect people’s lives, like
education, housing and employment. Look
at Detroit and see how excellent leadership is fixing a once failing city. We should
continue to empower local governments
to address the needs of our society, but we
should be asking our federal government
to do the same.
I have already commented about needing
real policies that include thoughtful plans
to increase growth and create more opportunity for everyone. Faster growth will
raise incomes, generate opportunities and
create the wherewithal to fund improvements in our social welfare programs.
(On pages 48-49, I describe some possible
solutions to the problems previously highlighted on pages 43-44.) These solutions
are not my own but are a synthesis of
some of the best thoughts that we have
seen. Some of these solutions are simple,
and some are more complex. And obviously, if they were politically easy to put
into practice, that would have been done
by now. However, I am convinced that if
we could get ideas like these implemented,
economic growth and opportunity for all
would be greatly enhanced.

Some solutions to how we might drive growth, incomes and opportunity
EDUCATION
We know what to do. High schools and community colleges
should work with local businesses to create specific skills
training programs, internships and apprenticeships that
prepare graduating students to be job-ready — whether they
go on to earn a credential, to work or to attend college. With
7 million job openings and 6 million unemployed workers in
the United States, there is an opportunity for companies to
work with local institutions, including community colleges and
local apprenticeship programs. Business must be involved
in this process, and it needs to be done locally because that
is where the actual jobs are. Germany does an exceptional
job at apprenticeships. Germany has one of the strongest
education and training systems in the world, with about 1.5
million young people annually participating in apprenticeship programs that are paid opportunities to gain in-demand
skills along with an education. The vocational schools and
apprenticeship programs work directly with local businesses
to ensure students are connected to available jobs upon
graduation. Germany’s youth unemployment rate is one of the
lowest in the world.
Some countries are now implementing mandatory preschool
for children at three years of age. This is a wonderful policy. It
makes childcare less expensive and has proved to be extraordinarily good for student education short and long term.
Parents like it, too. Of course, the benefits may not be seen for
many years, but this is precisely the type of long-term thinking
in policymaking that we need.
HEALTHCARE
This may be our toughest, most complicated problem, but we know
there are some things we can do to make the system work better.
Some of the solutions may include aligning incentives better; trying
to eliminate the extraordinary amount of money wasted on
bureaucracy, administration and fraud; empowering employees to
make better choices, with upfront transparency in employer plan
pricing and options and the actual cost of medical procedures;
developing better corporate wellness programs, focusing particularly on obesity and smoking; creating better tools to shop around
for non-emergency care and manage healthcare expenses; and
reducing the extraordinary expense for unwanted end-of-life care.
Another obvious thing to do is to start teaching wellness, nutrition,
health and exercise in K-12 classrooms nationwide.
REGULATORY REFORM
Starting a small business today generally requires multiple licenses,
which take precious months to get. But it doesn’t end there. Talk
with any small business owner and that person will describe the
mountains of red tape, inefficient systems and a huge amount of
documentation involved to operate the business. We need to reduce
the number of licenses that are required to open and run a small
business. In addition, we should look at the excessive state and local
rules affecting small businesses, consolidating and eliminating
unnecessary rules and regulations where possible. And all
regulations should have a thorough cost-benefit analysis and be
periodically reviewed for current relevancy.
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT
The 2015 transportation spending bill, Fixing America’s Surface
Transportation Act (FAST Act), is intended to fund surface transportation programs — including highways — at over $305 billion through
2020. Its aim is to improve mobility on America’s highways; create
jobs and support economic growth; decrease bureaucracy in getting
projects approved and completed — and we need to finish its
implementation. Again, experience from other countries may help.
We could learn from Germany and Canada, for example, whose
officials endorsed large infrastructure projects and sped through
permitting in two to three years by forcing federal, state and local
approvers to simultaneously work through a single vetting process.
Significantly reducing the time of permitting also dramatically reduces
the cost and uncertainty around making major capital investments.
TAX CREDITS AND BENEFITS
The business tax changes in the 2017 tax law made the United States
more competitive, benefiting American workers today and strengthening our economy for the long term. In 2018, nominal wages
increased 3.3% — the fastest rate of growth since 2008 — and job
openings exceeded the number of unemployed workers for the first
time since the federal government started tracking these data in
2000. Beyond this important progress, there is still more that
policymakers could do to help working Americans. Of the 150 million
Americans working today, approximately 21 million earn between
$7.25 an hour (the prevailing federal minimum wage) and $10.10 an
hour. It is hard to live on $7-$10 an hour, particularly for families
(even if two household members are working). While it would be
acceptable to increase minimum wages, this should be done locally 
49
LITIGATION
While the rule of law and the right of plaintiffs to get their day
in court are sacrosanct, there have to be ways to improve this
system. One example, which works in many other countries, is to
have the loser pay in some circumstances. Clearly, this would have
to be done in such a way as to ensure that aggrieved parties are
not denied appropriate access to our justice system. But we need
a way to reduce frivolous litigation designed principally to extract
fees for lawyers. We also need to reduce the time and the cost
necessary to achieve justice by adding more judges and creating
more specialty courts to deal with complex issues.
IMMIGRATION
There has been support for bipartisan comprehensive legislation
that provides substantial money for border security, creates more
merit-based immigration, makes DACA permanent and gives a
path to legal status or citizenship for law-abiding, hard-working,
undocumented immigrants. We know this is no easy feat, but we
should pass and enact legislation to resolve immigration.
MORTGAGE LENDING
Things can be done to reform mortgage markets, which would
increase mortgage availability — as I mentioned in the previous
sidebar on pages 43-44.
STUDENT LENDING
We should have programs to ameliorate the burden of student loans
on some former students. We would be well-advised to have more
properly designed underwriting standards around the creation of
student loans. Direct government lending to students has grown
almost 500% over the last 10 years — and it has not all been
responsible lending. It would also be helpful for the government to
disclose student lending programs as if they were accountable on
the same basis as a bank. Addressing these factors would lead to
far better, and healthier, student lending.
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION
We have already mentioned two critical solutions that would help
improve labor force participation — make work pay more by
expanding the EITC and provide graduating students with work skills
that will lead to better paying jobs. Remember, jobs bring dignity.
That first job is often the first rung on the ladder. People like working,
and studies show that once people start working, they continue
working. Jobs and living wages lead to better social outcomes — more
household formation, more marriages and children, and less crime,
as well as better health and overall well-being.
Reducing recidivism of those who have been incarcerated is not only
important to citizens with a criminal record and their families — but it
can also have profound positive implications for public safety. Last
year, we welcomed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s
proposed changes to allow banks more flexibility in hiring citizens
convicted of a crime. Our responsibility to recruit, hire, retain and
train talented workers extends to this population, and we will support
re-entry programs and give convicted and/or formerly incarcerated
Americans a path to well-paying jobs. Finally, we should all be
gratified that the government now seems to be taking the opioid
problem very seriously.
and carefully so it does not increase unemployment. Perhaps a
more effective step would be to expand the Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC). Today, the EITC supplements low- to moderateincome working individuals and couples, particularly with children.
For example, a single mother with two children earning $9 an hour
(approximately $20,000 a year) could receive a tax credit of more
than $5,000 at year’s end. Last year, the EITC program cost the
United States about $63 billion, and 25 million individuals received
the credit. We should convert the EITC to make it more like a
negative income payroll tax, which would spread the benefit,
reduce fraudulent and improper payments, and get it into more
people’s hands. Workers without children receive a very small tax
credit — this should be dramatically expanded, too.
PROPER BUDGETING AND PLANNING
All levels of government should do proper budgeting and planning
— and on a multi-year basis. It is particularly important that most
federal programs — think military, infrastructure and education
— have good long-term plans and be held accountable to execute
them. When the government says it is going to spend money, it
should tell the American people what the expected outcome is and
report on it. It should account for loans the same way the private
sector does, and it should be required to do cost-benefit analysis.
50
III. PUBLIC POLICY
Somehow we need to help reinvent government to make it more efficient and nimble
in the new world. While the federal government remains somewhat in a stalemate, we
have seen governors and mayors at the state
and local levels taking active control and
framing effective solutions. They are helping
to create a laboratory of what works and are
often at the forefront with initiatives that
restore confidence in the ability of government to deliver. We also call upon CEOs
and other leaders to step up and offer
non-parochial solutions.
Despite the fact that CEOs are not generally
viewed with high levels of trust, surprisingly,
the 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer global
report – encompassing a general global
population of more than 33,000 respondents
– shows that 76% think CEOs should take
a stand on challenging issues and that 75%
actually trust their employer.
We believe CEOs can and should get involved
– particularly when they or their companies
can uniquely help design policies that are
good for America. At JPMorgan Chase, we are
strengthening our public policy teams to take
our advocacy and ideas to the next level. We
believe the best way to scale programs that
we have seen work in cities, states and countries around the globe is to develop actionable public policies that allow more people to
benefit from economic growth.
We can use our unique capabilities, data
and resources to help inform infrastructure policies, corporate governance policies,
affordable housing policies, financial education policies and inclusion policies, as well
as small business financing and formation,
community and economic development, and
others. In addition, while almost all companies can help further job skills, training, and
diversity and inclusion efforts, each company
can also add value where it has distinct
capabilities, like expertise around healthcare,
infrastructure or technology.
One final thought: If I were king for a day,
I would always have a competitive business
tax system and invest in infrastructure and
education as a sine qua non to maximize
the long-term health and growth of our
economy and our citizens. I would not trade
these issues off – I would figure out a way to
properly pay for them.
5. CEOs: Your country needs you!
It’s not enough just for companies to meet
the letter and the spirit of the law. They can
also aggressively work to improve society.
They can take positions on public policy
that they think are good for the country.
And they can decide, with proper policies
and regulatory oversight, with whom and
how they will do business.
However, this does get complex. What
companies cannot do is abridge the law of
the land or abrogate the rights of voters
and their representatives to set the law of
the land. There are circumstances in which
JPMorgan Chase is called upon to do things
and/or set policies that should have been
set by the federal government – in effect,
these are decisions that the voter must
decide. We work very hard to try to stay on
the right side of all these issues.
In any event, things have changed. In the
past, boards and advisors to boards advised
company CEOs to keep their head down
and stay out of the line of fire. Now the
opposite may be true. If companies and
CEOs do not get involved in public policy
issues, making progress on all these problems may be more difficult.

III. PUBLIC POLICY
6. America’s global role and engagement are indispensable.
One of the biggest uncertainties in the
world today is America’s role on the world
stage. A more secure and more prosperous
world is also good for the long-term security
and prosperity of the United States. And
America’s role in building that more secure
world has been and will likely continue to
be indispensable.
While there are many legitimate complaints
about international organizations (the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the
World Trade Organization and the United
Nations), the world is better off with these
institutions. America should engage and
exercise its power and influence cautiously
and judiciously. We should all understand
that global laws, standards and norms will be
established whether or not our nation participates in setting them. It is certain that we
will be happier with the evolution of global
standards if we help craft and implement
them. We should not abdicate this role. To
the contrary, it is critical that America help
develop the best global standards in trade,
immigration, corporate governance and
many other important issues.
While I have a deep and abiding faith in the United States of America
and its extraordinary resiliency and capabilities, we do not have a divine
right to success. Our challenges are significant, and we should not
assume they will take care of themselves. Let us all do what we can to
strengthen our exceptional union.
I would like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation for the
employees of JPMorgan Chase. From this letter, I hope shareholders
and all readers gain an appreciation for the tremendous character and
capabilities of our people and how they have helped communities
around the world. I hope you are as proud of them as I am.
