2018 was a landmark year for HCA Healthcare. We celebrated our company’s golden anniversary and the countless lives we
have positively impacted over those 50 years. Though much has changed in the field of healthcare since 1968, our founders’
vision remains the same: to provide the best patient care and service possible; to partner with physicians, nurses, and other
colleagues to achieve excellent outcomes; and to use the best of business to improve performance.
Our year of celebration was also a year of growth. Strategic investments in expanding our networks and clinical capabilities
continued to make it easier for patients to obtain high-quality, convenient patient care. At the same time, we took key steps
toward maintaining and growing the strength of our caregiver relationships, laying the groundwork for a new enterprise brand,
and completing a leadership transition that positions HCA Healthcare for continued growth and success going forward.
A Year of Growth
The year ended with our 19th
consecutive quarter of growth in
same-facility inpatient admissions.
HCA Healthcare generated revenues of
$46.7 billion, an increase of 7 percent
over 2017, with same-facility equivalent
admissions totaling 3.2 million. 2018 net
income attributable to HCA Healthcare,
Inc. was $3.8 billion and earnings per
diluted share was $10.66. In addition,
for the 10th consecutive year, we
obtained Ethisphere Institute’s award
as a World’s Most Ethical Company.
In 2018, we also continued to reinvest in
our company and markets. We finished
the year investing $3.6 billion of capital
in the communities we serve and plan
to invest more this year. We have in
excess of $3.5 billion of capital projects
in the pipeline. This will strengthen our
existing healthcare services and create
additional inpatient and outpatient
capacity within our local healthcare
systems. We also returned value to our
shareholders, completing $1.5 billion of
share repurchases in 2018 and initiating
a quarterly dividend.
This past year was also one of
expansion. In 2018, we agreed to
purchase Mission Health, a six-hospital
system in Asheville and western North
Carolina, for approximately $1.5 billion.
Recognized as one of the nation’s top
15 health systems by IBM Watson
Health in six of the past seven years,
the system now operates as the newly
created North Carolina Division. The
proceeds of the sale, which closed early
in 2019, were used to fund the nonprofit
Dogwood Health Trust, whose purpose
is to improve the health and well-being
of the people and communities of
western North Carolina.
In addition to Mission Health, we made
other acquisitions that enhanced our
networks, including Memorial Health in
Savannah, Georgia and North Cypress
Medical Center in Houston, Texas.
To complement our acquisition strategy,
we invested in the expansion of our care
settings to provide better access and
convenience by locating facilities closer
to where our patients live and work. At
year end, we operated 179 hospitals,
142 ambulatory and GI surgery centers,
84 free-standing emergency rooms, 130
urgent care centers, and 1,120 physician
clinics. This market-focused approach of
offering diverse sites of care is designed
to make it easier for our patients to
receive the healthcare services they
need, when they need them.
Raising the Bar for Quality Patient Care
With HCA Healthcare’s growth and
scale comes great responsibility
to ensure we deliver high-quality,
convenient care to our patients. Over
the past five years, we have increased
the complexity of service offerings
within our networks.
As a learning health system, our goal
is to identify best practices and make
them the standard of care across our
facilities. Repeatedly, we have achieved
this goal and raised the bar for the
practice of medicine across service
lines including:
Stroke: At year end, our median
stroke response time was 25
percent faster than the standard
national goal. With 26 accredited
comprehensive stroke centers,
HCA Healthcare’s talented stroke
experts use proven clinical protocols,
telemedicine, and coordinated care
to provide timely, state-of-the-art
service to our patients.
Trauma: HCA Healthcare is the
largest provider of trauma care and
burn care in the U.S., and we grew our
volume last year by six percent.
Sepsis: Sepsis is the body’s response
to overwhelming infection, and the
U.S. has approximately 1.5 million
sepsis cases annually. To combat
sepsis, in 2018 we completed an
enterprise-wide roll-out of SPOT
(Sepsis Prediction and Optimization
of Therapy), a predictive algorithm
and workflow we developed
based upon data from millions of
hospitalizations from our facilities.
Running 24/7, SPOT provides realtime decision support to physicians
and nurses to help detect sepsis
hours earlier and with greater
accuracy, helping to save lives.
Bone marrow transplants: There
have been enormous advances
in transplantation for cancer
patients, and Sarah Cannon, the
Cancer Institute of HCA Healthcare
performs more transplants than
any other network. With 17 percent
growth in 2018, we now have
accredited programs in Austin,
Dallas, Denver, Nashville, New
Orleans, and San Antonio, and
plan to open two more this year, in
Kansas City and Las Vegas.
Our approach, which uses our vast
clinical data warehouse in partnership
with our physicians and other
caregivers, consistently yields value for
our patients, value for our communities,
and value for our company.
Investing in Our People
Throughout our history, our operational
and clinical successes would not have
been possible without the people of
HCA Healthcare. Today, our 276,000
dedicated employees, including
94,000 nurses, and our 38,000
affiliated physicians drive our patient
experience, quality of care, and operating
performance. Recognizing their intrinsic
value, we are increasing our investments
in our nurses, colleagues, and physicians.
2018 was a landmark year for HCA Healthcare. We celebrated our company’s golden anniversary and the countless lives we
have positively impacted over those 50 years. Though much has changed in the field of healthcare since 1968, our founders’
vision remains the same: to provide the best patient care and service possible; to partner with physicians, nurses, and other
colleagues to achieve excellent outcomes; and to use the best of business to improve performance.

toward maintaining and growing the strength of our caregiver relationships, laying the groundwork for a new enterprise brand,
and completing a leadership transition that positions HCA Healthcare for continued growth and success going forward.
For HCA Healthcare, 2018 marked great
strides in our nursing operations. Our
commitment to our nurses has resulted
in a positive impact on clinical outcomes,
patient experience, efficiency of care,
and nurse engagement. Our efforts to
secure a robust pipeline of nurse leaders
have reduced chief nursing officer
vacancies and the time to fill these
critical positions. We also added more
than 6,200 registered nurses in 2018 by
decreasing turnover and improving our
recruitment and selection processes.
We employed new technologies to
improve communication between
patients and nurses and across care
teams through advanced nurse call and
iMobile. In addition, we completed the
deployment of a revised documentation
system that returned 30 minutes of
time to our nurses in each 12-hour shift
and generated data necessary to drive
improvement in clinical outcomes.
Finally, we successfully completed
the pilot of a new approach to clinical
education that will support professional
development throughout our nurses’
careers and meet the needs of our
patient population.
Moving forward, we will continue to
champion nursing initiatives that
enhance professional nursing practice and
improve patient safety, clinical outcomes,
and experience.
In 2018, HCA Healthcare also initiated an
investment of up to $300 million over
three years for programs that support
our colleagues’ career development, their
families, and their lives. Some programs are
already underway, including new paid family
leave benefits, tuition reimbursement
for most full- and part-time colleagues,
student loan debt assistance, expanded
certification offerings, and plans for a
scholarship program for children of HCA
Healthcare colleagues.
For our physicians, HCA Healthcare
continued investing in graduate medical
education (GME) programs, which allow
medical school graduates to complete
training required for licensure and specialty
board certification at our facilities. We
started 39 new nationally accredited GME
programs in 2018 and now have more than
230 GME programs with total enrollment
of more than 3,000 residents and 200
fellows last year. This makes our GME
program one of the largest providers of
residency and fellowship training across
the nation which better positions our
GME graduates to practice medicine at
the highest level, oftentimes at an HCA
Healthcare hospital.
To Our Valued Shareholders:
Milton Johnson
Chairman, HCA Healthcare
Milton Johnson, lef t
and Sam Hazen
Sam Hazen
CEO, HCA Healthcare
Sincerely,
HCA Healthcare believes that our people
and partners are our most valuable
resources. Together, the diverse members
of the HCA Healthcare team fulfill our
mission to care for and improve human
life. As part of that mission, it is our
responsibility to care for each other, our
patients, and the communities we serve.
Our Purpose-Driven Future
As we look to the future and invest more
than ever in achieving our mission, we
also believe it is time to tell our story
more broadly, more consistently, and
more succinctly. We want our colleagues,
our physicians, our payers, and others to
understand more clearly our combined
purpose, and the passion that drives
it. This is why we spent much of 2018
preparing to roll out a new purpose-driven
brand in 2019.
Our new brand does not mean that we
are going to change the names of our
facilities. What it will do is underscore and
support the reputation we have built in
the communities we serve.
Our enterprise brand will help explain
who we are as an organization and
define our common purpose: we exist
to give people a healthier tomorrow. It
will simplify our complexity, assist with
recruitment and retention, and, most
importantly, better define how we
collectively serve our patients.
We believe our outlook towards 2019
and beyond is compelling. Buoyed by
the differentiation of our scale and
capabilities, we seek to be the provider
of choice for patients, physicians and
payers in every community we serve.
The fundamentals in our markets are
strong, with rising demand for healthcare
services, and we are answering that
demand by expanding how and where we
deliver quality patient care. We believe
these factors will be a competitive
advantage and continue to provide
growth opportunities for us.
As of January 1, 2019, we had a smooth
management transition, with both of
us entering new roles after 36 years
with HCA Healthcare. We have worked
as a successful team for more than
two decades and understand the
responsibilities and accountability HCA
Healthcare has to our patients, colleagues,
physicians, shareholders, and communities.
In addition, we are excited to welcome
Thomas F. Frist III as the next chairman
of the board of directors following our
annual meeting in April. The Frist family’s
long-term stewardship, ownership,
and continued involvement reinforce
our mission and values and serves the
company and all stakeholders well. As we
look to the future, we are confident that
HCA Healthcare will continue its legacy as
a preeminent healthcare services provider.
