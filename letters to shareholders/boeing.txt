We are extremely grateful for the valuable contributions of Mr. Kenneth M. Duberstein, who will retire

Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, and we are very pleased that Ambassador
Nikki R. Haley, former U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, is a new nominee for
election to the Board of Directors.
Thank you for your ongoing support of The Boeing Company.
