For most of our clients, trust begins
with their reliance on the advice and
guidance of a New York Life agent.
More than just a highly trained financial
specialist, he or she brings to life our
commitment to acting with integrity
and humanity in all that we do.
Having no shareholders or outside
owners, we are strongly aligned with
our clients’ interests, just as we have
been since we opened for business
in 1845. Our commitment to the
people who turn to us for protection
permeates the entire organization,
beginning with our Board of Directors
and senior leadership team.
After nearly a decade of dedicated
service, our esteemed Board member
William G. Walter retired last April.
A seasoned senior executive whose
distinguished career included serving
as Chairman, President, and CEO of
FMC Corporation, his sound judgment
and wise counsel will be missed. We also
bid farewell to President John Y. Kim,
who retired at the end of December.
Bringing 25 years of deep expertise
across the investment, insurance, and
retirement businesses when he joined
New York Life in 2008, John played an
instrumental role in the company’s
tremendous growth and success in
the years following the financial crisis.
And in January 2019, we welcomed
our newest director, Robert F. Friel,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of PerkinElmer, Inc., to our Board.
As we move toward our 175th year
in business in 2020 and consider how
much the world around us has changed,
some things will always be the same
at New York Life. Delivering financial
security and peace of mind remains
our top priority. And our clients’ trust
remains our most important asset.
Thank you for your interest in
our company.
TED MATHAS
Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer
