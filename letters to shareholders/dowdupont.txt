The Board of Directors of DowDuPont Inc. (the “Board”) has set the close of business on April 26, 2019, as the record date for
determining stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of the 2019 Meeting and to vote.
As permitted by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules, proxy materials were made available via the
internet. Notice regarding availability of proxy materials and instructions on how to access those materials were mailed to certain
stockholders of record on or about April 29, 2019 (the “Notice”). The instructions included how to vote online and how to request a
paper copy of the proxy materials. This method of notice and access gives the Company a lower-cost way to furnish stockholders
with their proxy materials.
Proof of stock ownership is necessary to attend the 2019 Meeting. Please see page 2 of the Proxy Statement for information on
attending in person.
Thank you for your continued support and your interest in DowDuPont Inc.
