To Fannie Mae:
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fannie Mae and consolidated entities (in conservatorship)
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the
effect of the material weakness identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company
has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the Company and our
report dated February 14, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an
explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s dependence upon the continued support from various agencies of the
United States Government, including the United States Department of Treasury and the Company’s conservator and
regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Material Weakness
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not

be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in
management’s assessment:
• Disclosure Controls and Procedures - The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures did not adequately
ensure the accumulation and communication to management of information known to the Federal Housing Finance
Agency (as conservator) that is needed to meet their disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws as
they relate to financial reporting.
This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the Company and this report does not
affect our report on such financial statements.
