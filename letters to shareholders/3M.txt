Our company has a tremendous
foundation, built up over
generations. We have cuttingedge technology platforms and
manufacturing capabilities.
We have leading brands and a
truly global reach. We also have
an incredible team of people
who leverage these strengths
to deliver premium results,
while helping solve some of the
world’s toughest challenges.
I was fortunate to join this company more
than 30 years ago, and have since led
businesses around the world. As strong as
3M is today, I know there is a lot more we
can and must do to reach our full potential.
My commitment to you as CEO is to build
on our foundation, and create an even
more competitive enterprise that delivers
extraordinary value to all of the stakeholders
that have placed their trust in us, including
our customers, shareholders, employees,
communities and business partners.

2018 Performance
2018 was an important year for our enterprise, as
we posted good results and continued to transform
for the future. We delivered broad-based organic
growth of more than 3 percent, with growth across
all business groups and geographic areas. Our team
expanded GAAP earnings-per-share by 12 percent to
$8.89, or $10.46 on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow
conversion was 91 percent, and we generated a strong
return on invested capital of more than 22 percent.
Premium margins remain a hallmark of 3M, and in
2018 we delivered adjusted margins of 25 percent.
We also posted record sales of $33 billion, while
returning $8.1 billion to shareholders through dividends
and share repurchases. Last year marked 60 straight
years of dividend increases for 3M shareholders,
and we have already announced a 6 percent
increase to our first-quarter dividend in 2019.
Beyond financial results, in 2018 we continued
to position 3M for long-term growth and value
creation. This includes good progress on each
of our four priorities – Portfolio, Transformation,
Innovation, and People & Culture – which I laid
out at our Investor Day in November 2018.
Our first priority is Portfolio. The ongoing review and
reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing
value for our customers and shareholders. We’ve
taken significant actions over the last several years,
including realigning from 40 businesses to 23, and
completing both acquisitions and divestitures. Yet
there is more we must do to stay relevant to the fastmoving needs of our customers and the marketplace.
In 2018, for example, we sold our communication
markets business, building on the successful portfolio
work we have done in recent years within Electronics
and Energy. We also announced the acquisition of
M*Modal’s technology business, which is a leading
provider of healthcare solutions powered by artificial
intelligence. This acquisition – which was finalized
in February of 2019 – will expand our ability to
improve outcomes for both patients and providers.
Our second priority – Transformation – is fundamentally
improving how we serve our customers, how we work,
and how we compete. The backbone of Transformation
is a new ERP system, and 2018 was an important year
in this journey. Our team successfully rolled out the ERP
system across all five business groups in the United
States, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of our
global sales. To date, we have deployed approximately
70 percent of our revenue on the new system, and
we’re now stepping up efforts to fully leverage this
progress and accelerate value realization for customers
and 3M. Ultimately, Transformation is making us a more
agile, more efficient and more competitive enterprise.
The third priority is Innovation. Innovation is fundamental
to our organic growth, and key to our long track
record of delivering premium margins and return on
invested capital. It allows us to create differentiated
solutions for our customers and superior returns for
our shareholders. For 3M, innovation is embedded
in our culture, and constantly fueled by investments
in both research and development and capital. In
2018 we invested $3.4 billion in the combination of
R&D and cap-ex, with accelerated investments in
priority growth platforms focused around health care,
transportation, safety, and infrastructure. Technology is
advancing rapidly in these market spaces, and 3M will
continue to capitalize on the resulting opportunities.
People & Culture – our fourth priority – is foundational
to each of the other priorities. Everything that
differentiates 3M starts with our people. In 2018 we
expanded development opportunities for 3Mers,
while deepening our commitment to diversity,
inclusion and sustainability. We also earned a number
of external recognitions, including being named one
of the world’s most ethical companies for the fifth
straight year and being included on the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the 19th consecutive year.

The 3M Value Model
Our four priorities are just one element of the 3M Value Model, which demonstrates how we deliver for all
stakeholders: customers, shareholders, employees, communities and business partners. I also presented this
at our November Investor Day, and I would like to share with you as well.
Vision
Our vision drives everything we do:
It is authentic to 3M and aspirational, and is an important part of our purpose as an enterprise.
Strengths
Our strengths help us continually innovate to create differentiated value. In our Customer-inspired Innovation
approach, we combine close engagement with customers, deep domain expertise in markets, and our technology
platforms to develop unique insights – which often include unarticulated needs of our customers.
We then leverage our four fundamental strengths. In technology, we apply our 46 platforms and deep intellectual
property across our businesses. One-third of our technology platforms sit in manufacturing, which enables us to
deliver higher quality and better performing products. 3M’s global reach then allows us to use those technology
and manufacturing strengths to serve markets around the world, where we have operations in over 70 countries
and sales in nearly all countries. Finally, our brand adds value in each of our businesses.
3M does this while maintaining a focus on our customers – the end users of our solutions. Most of our sales are
specified or designed into customer applications. While the channel to our end user may change over time, our
global commerce strategy is to connect directly to end users while leveraging the go-to-market model that will
deliver where, when and how the end user chooses.

Priorities
Our four priorities – Portfolio, Transformation, Innovation, and People & Culture – are positioning 3M for
long-term growth and value creation.
Values
Our values bind us together as one 3M – across business groups, functions and geographies. They include our
leadership behaviors, which lay out what we expect of our leaders to drive performance, develop others, and
win in the marketplace. Then, our Code of Conduct: we’ve earned our reputation for integrity and the trust of our
stakeholders over many decades, and no one at 3M is free to compromise it.
We also are working to make 3M the most inclusive enterprise we can be, helping us become an even more
diverse, creative and innovative company. Sustainability is an important value for us; it’s a key element of how we
apply science to life, and going forward we will be an even more visible leader and innovator in this area. Finally,
we will do even more to encourage and challenge every 3M employee to be their best.

New Five-Year Plan
Also during 3M’s Investor Day, I outlined new five-year
financial objectives covering 2019 through 2023:
• 8–11 percent growth in earnings per share;
• 3–5 percent organic sales growth;
• 20 percent return on invested capital; and
• 100 percent free cash flow conversion.
These targets are realistic but aggressive,
and reflect our confidence in the future of 3M.
Summary
It is a true honor to serve as CEO of our incredible
enterprise. I would like to take this opportunity to
recognize and thank Inge Thulin, whose leadership took
3M to new levels of performance. I especially thank
Inge for his leadership and mentorship throughout
my career, including over the last year as we worked
closely together in his role as executive chairman.
Looking ahead to the future, we know we are
facing a world that will continue to change rapidly.
We remain focused on executing our plans,
capitalizing on opportunities to drive stronger
growth, and creating even greater value for our
customers and for you, our shareholders.
Thank you for your confidence in 3M.
