Under the updated strategy, Deere will build on its global

its position as a global leader in construction equipment.
Deere’s businesses, though very different, are meant to
work together and operate in an integrated manner.
Our turf and forestry equipment operations have growth
opportunities of their own and help our dealers broaden

and reliable performance.

and named a leading employer in several countries where
we operate. Deere also was honored as corporate
partner of the year by the Society of Black Engineers,
an important acknowledgement of our commitment to
diversity and inclusion.
BEING A POWER FOR GOOD
Wherever we operate, Deere and its employees are
committed to sharing with others and being a Power for
Good. During the year, the company and its foundation
made charitable contributions of approximately $38 million,
helping improve lives throughout the world. These
contributions are made with purpose; they focus on
empowering smallholder farmers, helping local communities
thrive, and providing educational opportunities for all.
As in past years, Deere employees supported their
communities through extensive volunteer efforts.
Employees logged nearly 186,000 volunteer hours in 2018,
moving closer to our goal of one-million volunteer hours
over the six-year period ending in 2022.

In another instance, our tractor factory in Dewas, India,
began collecting runoff rain water to overcome an acute
water shortage. The collected water is treated and used
in daily factory operations.

Deere earned a number of accolades in 2018. The company
was included in a prominent listing of the world’s

Deere has long believed in supporting young people with
an interest in agriculture and in 2018 marked 75 years
of sponsoring the national FFA student organization.
Deere is FFA’s longest-running sponsor.
In addition, Deere expanded its work in support of
smallholder farmers in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa. Deere also was named the number-one U.S. company
for social innovation by the 2018 American Innovation
Index Awards. Sponsored in part by Fordham University,
the award recognizes the way a company’s activities
and products help society.
