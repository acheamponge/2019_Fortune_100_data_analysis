As the number one Auto and Homeowners insurer in
the United States, State Farm remains a strong choice
for customers. In 2018, State Farm Mutual achieved
an operating profit and continued to build our financial
strength, which allows us to deliver on the promises
we make and help our customers recover from the
unexpected.
The A.M. Best Co., which provides an independent
opinion of an insurance company’s ability to meet
obligations to policyholders, continues to give its
highest rating (A++) to State Farm Mutual.
Helping people – through the many ways we serve our
customers and our communities – is part of who we
are and what we’re about. Through our Neighborhood
of Good®, we’re leading a movement to encourage
and empower people to get involved and take action.
Working together, we believe we can make, and inspire,
a meaningful difference in our world.
Thank you for putting your trust in State Farm.
We are proud to serve you.
Michael L. Tipsord
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
