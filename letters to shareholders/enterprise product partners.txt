Enterprise had a landmark year in 2018. We celebrated our 20th anniversary as
a publicly traded partnership and our 50th anniversary since the formation of
our founding sponsor, Enterprise Products Company (“EPCO”). We marked these
milestones by setting 23 operational and financial records in 2018. Our strong
performance was primarily from record NGLs, crude oil and natural gas volumes
transported across our integrated pipeline system, new assets put into service and
expansions of existing assets.
We also made significant progress in transitioning from the master limited
partnership (“MLP”) financial model, which relies heavily on the equity capital
markets and continuous issuance of new equity to fund growth capital projects,
to a more traditional model in financing our company. In 2018, we achieved
our goal of self-funding the equity portion, or 50 percent, of our growth capital
investments, a year ahead of schedule. We believe self-funding our equity,
investing in projects with attractive returns on capital, and maintaining our
best-in-class balance sheet will enhance the value of the partnership units and
support cash flow per unit growth.
This stronger financial position enabled our general partner’s board of directors
to authorize a $2 billion multi-year common unit buyback program which
provides us another “tool in the toolbox” to return capital to our investors, in
addition to distribution growth. Our management also provided guidance for
distributions to be declared with respect to 2019 of $1.765 per unit, or a 2.3 percent
increase compared to 2018. This guidance is based on management’s current
expectations, and the distribution with respect to each quarter of 2019 is subject to
management’s final recommendation to, and approval by, the board of directors.

RECORD PERFORMANCE
Enterprise reported a 29 percent increase in total gross operating margin to a
record $7.3 billion compared to 2017, with each of our four business segments
reporting increases. We reported net income attributable to limited partners for
2018 of $4.2 billion, or $1.91 per unit on a fully diluted basis, which represents a
47 percent increase compared to $1.30 per unit on a fully diluted basis for 2017.
Net cash flow provided by operating activities (“CFFO”) for 2018 increased 31
percent to a record $6.1 billion. Distributions to limited partners declared with
respect to 2018 were $3.8 billion, or 62 percent of CFFO. Free cash flow for 2018
increased 50 percent to a record $2.0 billion compared to 2017.
In terms of MLP financial measures, Enterprise’s strong performance led to
record DCF of $5.8 billion, excluding proceeds from asset sales and monetization
of interest rate derivatives. This level of DCF enabled us to increase the cash
distributions we paid to our partners for 2018 by 2.5 percent when compared to
comparable declarations for 2017 and provided a solid 1.5 times coverage of 2018
distributions. We retained $2.2 billion of DCF, which allowed us to self-fund the
equity portion of our growth capital investments of $4.2 billion.
Enterprise has increased its cash distribution rate for 20 consecutive years, or
every year since its initial public offering (“IPO”) in 1998. Since our IPO, we have
paid $31 billion in total cash distributions, while retaining more than $14 billion, or
31 percent of total DCF, to reinvest in the partnership. Total gross operating margin,
free cash flow and DCF are Non-GAAP financial measures that are defined and
reconciled later in this letter to investors.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
In 2018, we completed construction, began commercial activities or ramped up
volumes on assets totaling more than $5 billion of capital investment. These new
assets include our PDH facility, Midland-to-ECHO 1 crude oil pipeline, ninth NGL
fractionator at our Mont Belvieu-area complex, and two natural gas processing
plants serving the Delaware Basin of the Permian. Due to growing global demand
for PGP, we are in discussions with several customers for the development of a
second PDH facility.
Our Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline is currently transporting approximately 570
thousand barrels per day (“MBPD”) of Permian crude oil to domestic and export
markets on the Texas Gulf Coast under long-term, fee-based contracts. We are in
the process of completing a cost effective expansion that will increase the capacity
to 620 MBPD.
Another notable achievement in 2018 included our loading the first VLCC at a Texas
port. A VLCC has a 75-foot draft and can transport two million barrels of crude oil.
To more efficiently and economically export U.S. crude, we filed an application in
January 2019 with the Maritime Administration (“MARAD”) to build an offshore port
in water deep enough to fully load a VLCC without the need for reverse lightering.
Our proposed Sea Port Oil Terminal would be able to load a tanker at 85,000 barrels
per hour, giving us the capability to load a two million barrel VLCC in 24 hours.
The final investment decision on this project is subject to obtaining the requisite
regulatory approvals and sufficient long-term, fee-based contracts.
In September 2018, we jointly announced with CME Group, a pilot program for
a new WTI Houston Crude Oil futures contract with three delivery points on
Enterprise’s system. Our Houston-area distribution network offers unmatched
connectivity via an extensive network of pipelines, storage facilities and marine
terminals with access to more than 4 million BPD of crude oil supply from the
major producing basins in the U.S. and Canada, making it an ideal pricing point.
WTI Houston Crude Oil futures began listing with the January 2019 contract
month. CME Group is the owner and operator of the largest commodities futures
exchanges, including the New York Mercantile Exchange.
CURRENT MACRO ENERGY OUTLOOK
Global demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas continues to increase, driven by
economic growth, initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the desire by
developing countries to upgrade their standards of living. Production from U.S. shale
resources is playing an important role in supplying this growth while contributing
to lower energy prices to the end use consumer. The International Energy Agency
(“IEA”) recently reported that global demand for crude oil and NGLs grew by a
combined 1.3 million BPD in 2018; and expects demand to grow by 1.4 million BPD
in 2019.
With production more than double domestic demand, the U.S. has become the
largest exporter of liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) in the world. LPG is comprised
of propane and butane. The majority of the demand growth has come from many
developing countries promoting cleaner fuels, such as propane, to replace coal and
wood, which reduces emissions and deforestation. Government-sponsored programs
to promote LPG usage have been successful in countries such as China, India,
Indonesia and Nigeria.
U.S. exports of natural gas have increased by approximately 100 percent since
2015 as the result of five billion cubic feet per day (“Bcf/d”) of U.S. liquefied
natural gas (“LNG”) facilities commencing operations. Most of these LNG export
cargoes are serving markets in Asia and Europe to fuel new power generation
facilities or displace coal at existing power plants to reduce emissions and
improve air quality. As an example, from 2007 to 2017 the U.S. reduced its CO2
emissions 14 percent by increasing its usage of natural gas for power generation
in combination with renewable energy.
With respect to the domestic petrochemical industry, abundant supplies of
shale-sourced ethane provide the U.S. with one of the cheapest feedstocks
available for ethylene production. The American Chemistry Council estimates
the petrochemical industry is investing over $200 billion to expand U.S. chemical
production, with most of the investments tied directly to producing ethylene from
cost-advantaged ethane.
International demand for U.S. ethane is also expected to remain robust in 2019, as
production from domestic shale basins offers the global petrochemical industry a
low-cost feedstock option and supply diversification.
Finally, as U.S. crude oil production increases, exports continue to replace
imports, with most of the barrels destined for markets in Central and South
America, Asia and Western Europe where the lighter U.S. crudes are refined.
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS
We begin 2019 with $6.7 billion of growth capital projects under construction.
We also have a number of infrastructure projects under development that
should result in the announcement of additional growth capital projects. These
new projects provide additional visibility to future cash flow growth. The major
projects under construction or recently completed include:

n Conversion of one EPD Seminole NGL pipeline to crude oil service
The Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline began limited service in February 2019 and is
scheduled to begin full commercial service with approximately 200 MBPD of
transportation capacity in April 2019. Supported by a 10.75-year agreement, this
pipeline will add much needed capacity to move crude oil from the Permian Basin
to markets in the Houston area.
n Shin Oak NGL pipeline
The 658-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline will add 550 MBPD of NGL
transportation capacity from the Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu. It began limited
service in February 2019, transporting NGLs from our new Orla gas plants, and
NGLs diverted as a result of the conversion of one EPD Seminole NGL pipeline
to crude service, as well as other third party NGLs. The Shin Oak pipeline is
also supported by a dedication from Apache Corporation for all of their NGL
production from the Alpine High development.
n Third Orla and Mentone natural gas processing plants
The third natural gas processing plant at our Orla Complex in the Delaware Basin
is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2019, and the Mentone
processing plant is scheduled to begin service in the first quarter of 2020. Upon
completion of these facilities, the partnership will have approximately 1.6 Bcf/d of
natural gas processing capacity and 250 MBPD of NGL production capacity in the
Permian (Delaware Basin).
n Two new NGL fractionators at Mont Belvieu Complex
We began construction on two NGL fractionators adjacent to our Mont Belvieu
complex that will add 300 MBPD of much needed capacity to handle the increased
volume of NGLs expected from the Permian Basin. Upon completion in 2020, our
NGL fractionation capacity at the Mont Belvieu complex will be approximately
1.1 million BPD.
n New ethylene export terminal
We have formed a joint venture to build an ethylene export terminal along the
U.S. Gulf Coast with the capacity to export approximately one million tons of
ethylene per year. Supporting the joint venture will be associated dock, storage
and pipeline assets. The facility will support growing U.S. ethylene production by
providing producers the flexibility to access international markets rather than
relying solely on the export of derivative products such as polyethylene. The
ethylene export terminal is expected to begin limited commercial operations in
the fourth quarter of 2019.
SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As Enterprise continues to grow, we remain focused on three primary areas that
reflect our commitment to being a safe and reliable operator:
 1) Safety and environmental protection;
 2) Productive engagement with the community and other stakeholders;
 3) Capable and well-trained personnel with access to the resources necessary
 to perform their jobs effectively.
For more information, please see our recent publication, “Safety, Environment & Social
Responsibility” on our website.
