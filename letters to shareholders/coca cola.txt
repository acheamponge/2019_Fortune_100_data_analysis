On May 8, 1886, a store
in Atlanta served the first
Coca-Cola.
Today, that now-famous drink forms
the foundation for a total beverage
company that offers more than 500
brands and 4,300 products worldwide.
While many brands have come and
gone during the past 133 years,
our success is based in part on our
history of investing in the success
and sustainability of the communities
we call home, from our hometown of
Atlanta to more than 200 countries
and territories where you can find our
products today.
In 2018, we continued to transform our
portfolio and, in turn, our company.
We delivered strong, geographically
balanced revenue growth and value
share gains in line with our strategy.
There are many highlights, including:
More innovation, including options
with less sugar:
• Globally, sparkling soft drink
volume was up 2% in 2018, fueled
by double-digit volume growth of
Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, along with
strong performance from new, lowand no-calorie versions of sparkling
beverages such as Sprite and Fanta.
• Our innovations included Coca-Cola
Plus Coffee, now available in
multiple markets around the world,
and a restage for Diet Coke in
North America that included new
packaging, marketing and flavors.
• We launched about 600 new
products. Of those, more than 250
were low- or no-sugar, and more
than 400 were juices, teas, waters
and other non-sparkling beverages. 
Lifting, shifting and scaling
brands around the world:
• We used the strength of our
distribution system to help launch
brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater
and AdeS across multiple markets
with increased speed and agility.
• Worldwide, we expanded 165
products into additional markets
in 2018.
Making strategic investments
for the future:
• We strengthened and expanded
our portfolio through mergers
and acquisitions, including
Costa Limited, which closed in
early 2019 and gives us a global
coffee platform.
• We invested in a strategic
partnership with the premium
sports hydration brand
BODYARMOR, one of the fastestgrowing beverage trademarks in
the U.S.
Investing in the Coca-Cola system
advantage:
• We are aligned with our bottling
partners to capture growth
opportunities. Since 2010, we’ve
invested—with our system—more
than $125 billion to strengthen
our platform for growth, including
technology, such as connected
coolers; and in new plants and
route-to-market innovation.
• For example, our bottling partner
Arca Continental, the first Latin
American bottler to operate in the
U.S., announced a $250 million
investment in a new facility in Texas
to help us get more drinks to the
market faster.

The Coca-Cola Company 2018 Business & Sustainability Report 3
Building leadership for success
and a growth culture:
• We announced several key
leadership appointments, including
Brian Smith as president and chief
operating officer, John Murphy as
chief financial officer, and new group
and business unit presidents.
• Our new Global Ventures group,
led by Jennifer Mann, was created
to ensure we connect and globally
scale key acquisitions, investments
and brands such as Costa, innocent,
Dogadan and Monster.
• These changes will help us continue
to build a culture that fuels our
transformation and supports
growth worldwide.
Creating Shared Opportunity
through Growth
While we’re proud of our business
results in 2018, companies like ours
have a responsibility as leaders. As
we grow, we will continue to support
local economies and help create
economic opportunity.
Our commitment to doing business the
right way continued in 2018, as we set
out to show the world that the drinks
they love can make life more enjoyable,
without harming our planet and the
natural resources we all depend on.
In early 2018, we announced our World
Without Waste initiative with a clear,
simple goal: to help collect and recycle
a bottle or can for each one we sell by
2030. The company’s progress during
the first year included:
• establishing or joining 10 global
recycling/packaging partnerships;
• announcing four packaging
technology advancements including
the opening of our PlantBottleTM IP
for use across the industry; and
• launching bottles made from
100% recycled materials in
multiple markets.
We replenished 155% of the water
we use in our finished beverages
to communities and nature in 2018,
continuing to exceed our 2020 goal. We
also economically empowered more
than 865,000 women in 2018, adding
an additional 17 countries.
We don’t just recognize our
responsibility to be a part of the
solution to challenges we all
face—we embrace it.
For us, that means using our size,
scale and success to create shared
opportunity through growth—creating
real opportunity for our communities,
our customers, our employees and
our shareowners.
Leveraging Data to Help Us Grow
Our Business the Right Way
Finally, I am a firm believer in the
importance of data. In a digital and
data-driven world, good information
helps us make better decisions.
When we share our data, we can help
drive collective accountability for us
and others.
In this year’s report—our first combined
business and sustainability report—
we created a detailed Data Appendix
to share more details on our progress
and metrics. This is an idea born from
stakeholder engagement and our belief
that, working together, we can create a
positive impact and respond effectively
to the collective challenge of the
UN Sustainable Development Goals.
We are pleased with our progress
against some of our goals, while
recognizing that more needs to be
done in other areas. We will continue to
take action and grow our business the
right way—not the easy way.
Sincerely,
James Quincey
Chief Executive Officer
April 24, 2019
