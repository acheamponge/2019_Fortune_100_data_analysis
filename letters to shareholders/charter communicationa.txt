In May of 2016, we closed our large and
complex transactions with Time Warner
Cable and Bright House Networks, putting
three companies together in order to
create a new company with a larger and
more concentrated footprint, giving us
the scale to innovate and grow faster.
After two and a half years of integration,
Charter is beginning to benefit from those
transactions in all the ways we expected.
When we started the process of pursuing
additional scale in cable in 2013, we
knew that to fully benefit from any
acquisitions, we would need to create
a single operating entity with a unified
product, marketing, technology and
service infrastructure. We have spent
over two years doing that. And while we
still have some work to do, virtually all of
the customer-facing initiatives related to
our integration are now behind us.
As of the end of 2018, we had migrated
over 70% of our acquired residential
customers to our Spectrum pricing
and packaging. In 2018, we also
completed our all-digital initiative and
the upgrade to DOCSIS 3.1, allowing us
to offer Gigabit speeds across our entire
footprint. Our service infrastructure is
now national, specialized and consistent,
and our field operations and customer
operations insourcing are nearly complete.
Finally, we launched Spectrum MobileTM
last summer with positive early results.
Despite all of that integration activity,
Charter performed well operationally and
financially in 2018. We added 1.3 million
Internet customers in 2018, for growth
of 5.3%. For the full year, we grew our
cable revenue2
 by 4.7% to $43.5 billion,
and total revenue grew to over $43.6
billion. Our 2018 cable Adjusted EBITDA2
grew by a strong 6.5%, to $16.3 billion.
And net income attributable to Charter
shareholders reached over $1.2 billion.
In addition, we generated $2.8 billion
of cable free cash flow2
 in 2018, and
repurchased approximately $5.0 billion
of Charter stock and Charter Holding
partnership units, despite investing
nearly $500 million through the launch
of Spectrum Mobile. As we look to 2019,
in addition to completing the last pieces
of our integration, we remain focused
on a number of key strategic priorities,
including:
? Driving higher sales volumes: Late in
the third quarter, we executed the full
market launch of Spectrum Mobile,
with the goal of using that product
to drive faster overall customer
relationship growth. We have
positioned Spectrum Mobile to be
the triple play driver for connectivity
sales, similar to the successful

6 2018 ANNUAL REPORT
strategy that we pursued with wireline
voice over the last decade. We expect
our effectiveness at selling mobile to
continue to improve, especially as we
expand our “bring-your-own-device”
program throughout 2019. Ultimately,
we believe that the consumer savings
from our mobile offering will lead to
better retention and drive incremental
cable sales over the longer term.
? Reducing service transactions and
churn: With the vast majority of our
integration behind us, we expect to
see a meaningful reduction in network
activity, customer equipment swaps,
service calls and truck rolls. Service
activity should also decline as our
better products, pricing and service
across a larger base of customers
improve and as we begin to benefit
from enhanced online self-service
and greater levels of self-installation.
We anticipate the lower level of
activity in 2019 will raise customer
satisfaction, reduce churn and extend
customer lifetimes.
? Reducing capital intensity: Our
goal at the beginning of this process
was to put our combined assets
in a position to operate as a single
entity, and to grow faster over the
long term. As a result, we needed
to increase our capital spending in
the short term. That higher spending
is now behind us, and cable capital
intensity will fall significantly in 2019,
as planned, but also beyond 2019,
as CPE spend per home declines,
consumers increasingly install their
own devices, the reliability of our
plant improves and our network
becomes increasingly cloud-based
and IP-driven—all on higher
expected revenue.
Ultimately, our long-term growth
opportunity comes from our powerful,
easy-to-upgrade network that allows us
to offer data-rich wireline and wireless
products that consumers want and
businesses need. We believe our current
customer relationship penetration is
low relative to our potential, given the
current and future quality of our wireline
and wireless products. The capability of 
our plant will continue to expand with
advanced DOCSIS products and the
convergence of our wireline and wireless
architectures, allowing us to offer highcapacity, high-compute, low-latency
connectivity products both inside and
out of the home.
We believe we have an excellent runway
for customer growth and significant
opportunities for operational cost
efficiencies from improving products and
service and by reducing transactions.
With our biggest integration initiatives
behind us, we are in a position to drive
long-term, sustainable customer
relationship growth and Adjusted
EBITDA growth. Additionally, our
expected growth, combined with our
declining capital intensity, balance
sheet strategy and tax assets, should
yield industry-leading free cash flow per
share growth in the coming years.
I would like to thank our investors for
their continued support and all of our
employees for their dedication.

Thomas M. Rutledge
