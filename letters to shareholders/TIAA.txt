Beginning on January 1, 2021, as permitted by regulations adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, paper copies of the CREF Accounts’ (the “Accounts”) annual and
semiannual reports will no longer be sent by mail, unless you specifically request paper
copies of the reports. Instead, they will be made available on TIAA’s website, TIAA.org, and
you will be notified by mail each time a report is posted and provided with a website link
to access the report.
If you already elected to receive these reports electronically, you will not be affected
by this change and you need not take any action. You may elect to receive reports
and other communications from the Accounts electronically anytime by either updating
your account settings at TIAA.org/eDelivery, if you hold your Account units through a
TIAA-affiliated financial intermediary, account or retirement plan (each, a “TIAA Account”),
or by contacting your financial intermediary (such as a broker/dealer or bank) through
which you hold Account units.
If you invest in the Accounts through a TIAA Account, you may elect to continue to receive all
future reports in paper free of charge by updating your account settings at TIAA.org/eDelivery
or by calling 877-518-9161 during regular business hours. If you invest through another
financial intermediary, you can contact your financial intermediary to request that you
continue receiving paper copies of your reports. Your election to receive reports in paper
will apply to all funds held through your financial intermediary or, if you invest through a
TIAA Account, to all funds held with the Accounts and any other investment companies
within the same group of related investment companies.
