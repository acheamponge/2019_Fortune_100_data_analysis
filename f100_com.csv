1,Walmart,514405,1,500343,2300000,C. Douglas McMillon,President Chief Executive Officer &  Director,Retailing,General Merchandisers,25,Bentonville,AR,36.3728538,-94.2088172,"Sam Walton showed us the way. He gave us a clear purpose and four timeless values. At Walmart we save people money and help them live better — and we do it by serving others striving for excellence respecting everyone and acting with integrity.

Clear and constant.

You know what else is constant at Walmart? Change. As I visit with our associates all over the world and ask ""Other than our purpose and values the only thing that's constant at Walmart is ..."" and they respond: ""Change!"" It's a powerful mindset and our people have it.

These past five years in this role have passed quickly and it has been an exciting time to be at Walmart. Looking back I'm not sure I could have imagined some of the things we're doing in our business today but at the same time it feels like we're just getting started.

Our customers and Sam's Club members are being served by associates who are better equipped to create new ways of shopping and put today's technology to work. Our goal is to make it easy fast friendly and fun to shop with us.

Consider:

• A busy mom can shop on our app or get through the store faster by finding the items on her list thanks to the map feature on her Walmart app. She can make purchases with Walmart Pay and go digital to skip the pharmacy line and pick up a prescription.• Outside our stores customers can pull into a pickup spot have their personal shoppers put their order in their trunk and off they go. eCommerce has finally come to the food business and in a big way.

• We're putting technology to work with an autonomous scanner that checks our sidecounters to help us improve in-stock levels and an autonomous floor cleaner that carries a camera to gather data on our product features to share with a FAST Unloader system in the back room that prioritizes items for restocking.

• Our Sam's Clubs are becoming more digital. With our Scan & Go app customers bypass the checkout line and pay for items on their mobile device and now we're testing computer vision instead of barcodes to make the process even faster. Our new Membership Express can cut the time it takes to sign up from eight minutes to fewer than 60 seconds.

The ways we can use technology today and in the future are exciting but our business is still a people business. We are people-led and tech-empowered and that makes investing in our associates a strategic priority. On any given day our associates may be attending one of our new training academies in the U.S. or entering our new fast-track leadership program for Walmart International.

They may be benefitting from our expanded parental-leave policies or beginning their careers at Walmart with a starting wage 50 percent higher than it was four years ago. And they may be extending their education with a 1-a-day college degree through our Live Better U program. We've made a lot of changes with respect to opportunities for our associates and there's more to come.

No doubt the pace of change continues to increase.

Recently I was visiting with a group of students many of whom are joining our company and one of them asked me what I had learned during my five years in this position. Surprises? Revelations?

It's a good question and I've been giving it some thought. These five lessons came to the top of the list:

1. Leadership — You can't push a rope but you can pull it. In other words sometimes you just can't lead from behind. You can't muscle or push things along. As a leader during transformation you have to be out in front — show that you want to learn be curious introduce new ideas ask questions. Our people are talented competitive and have a sense of urgency. When they hear about a better way of doing things they engage learn and act.

2. Risk — There is no growth without change and there is no meaningful change without risk. So get comfortable with an intelligent level of risk. Otherwise the law of diminishing returns sets in as always doing the same things the same way takes over. We invested substantially in wages associate education pricing and eCommerce. We acquired Flipkart Jet and others and we partnered with global technology companies in places like China and Japan. We don't know what Sam would have done in these moments but we know he would have been adapting — and he would have been aggressive. We're drawing on that legacy today and tapping into that DNA.

3. Time Horizon — We're playing the long game. Our priority is to position our company for long-term success. History has shown us that companies that focused too much on the short term were doomed to fail. Managing our business on a daily basis is important but our most important strategic decisions are made in light of what we want our company to become for the next generation.

4. Our Associates — People will surprise you. Several times a week I see or hear about something creative our associates have done. It's inspiring to see their ingenuity and pace. Around the world Walmart associates feel more comfortable taking risk. They're launching minimum viable products to test and learn from. These have enough function to satisfy early adopters whose feedback informs future design. Result: We go from Product 1.0 to Product 2.0 a lot faster. This is a powerful unlock. We've always said that our people make the difference. We're certainly seeing that today.

5. Trust — It's a challenge to have the broader world know the Walmart we know. As we strive to make our company better we will also look for ways to build trust by communicating the good work our people are doing and its impact. Included is the work we are doing to strengthen our culture of integrity and improve our compliance talent processes and systems. In our supply chain we are eliminating waste using more renewable energy reducing carbon emissions and making our items and the packages they come in healthier and more sustainable. Of course we aren't perfect. We make mistakes. But if the world could see all of the hard-working well-intentioned people inside our company who are making things better in their communities and in the world I'm convinced they would be moved by it all. I am. The progress we're making is reflected in our results. Last fiscal year we increased total revenue by 3 percent to 514.4 billion and we generated 27.8 billion in operating cash flow.

Breaking it down Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 3.6 percent excluding fuel — the highest annual growth rate in a decade — and eCommerce sales increased 40 percent nearly doubling the sales of that business over the past two years. And momentum continued at Sam's Club with comp sales growth of 3.8 percent excluding fuel.

Walmart International posted positive comps in eight of our markets including the four major markets as we also see our digital transformation and innovations taking hold outside the U.S.

In Mexico many of our customers don't have bank accounts so the team there launched a new app called Cashi that acts as a digital bank account. At our stores customers exchange cash for an electronic deposit onto their mobile device then use the app to shop in the store online and even to pay their other bills.

In many parts of China same-day delivery really means same-hour delivery. To meet that demand we invested in a crowd-sourced delivery platform and now customers in some locations can receive their merchandise within an hour of placing the order.

We are also making good progress on omnichannel initiatives in places like Canada and in Japan where we are partnering with eCommerce leader Rakuten to offer grocery delivery.

India has 1.3 billion people and an economy approaching 3 trillion yet its eCommerce business is less than 3 percent. With our acquisition of Flipkart we have positioned ourselves for growth in one of the top three markets in the world.

We are deliberate about where and how we operate. For example we finalized the majority sale of the business in Brazil and we continue to explore ways to best serve our customers around the world. This is a period of significant change at Walmart. I think the pace and magnitude of our changes are critical to the company's future as we adapt to an environment that is changing more quickly all the time.

We are changing how we work and what we do without changing our purpose and our values. To our customers thank you. We'll continue to work hard every day to earn your trust and business. To our associates we are proud of you. Keep it going. To our shareholders thank you for your interest in our company and your continued support.

Woods,Chairman &  Chief Executive Officer,Energy,Petroleum Refining,25,Irving,TX,32.8140177,-96.9488945,"As we mark the 20th anniversary of the merger that brought together Exxon and Mobil we do so with our strongest portfolio of investments in two decades. It positions us to deliver attractive returns for you our shareholders far into the future.
Message from the Chairman
 
In 2018 we laid out a growth strategy designed to take advantage of the unique strengths that have made ExxonMobil an industry leader. These include a sharp focus on fundamentals; dedication to innovative technology; deep integration across our businesses; disciplined investment in advantaged projects; and industry-leading execution from our highly skilled workforce. Our goal is to significantly increase the earnings and cash flow generation capacity of our business.

In last year’s volatile margin and price environment we generated earnings of 21 billion and cash flow from operations and asset sales of 40 billion – the highest since 2014. This strong performance enabled us to fund attractive investments reduce debt and increase the dividend by 6 percent – the 36th consecutive annual increase.

Our growth strategy takes advantage of our scale and expertise across each of our business lines.

In the Upstream we achieved many important milestones including advancements in five key worldclass projects that will add significant new production.

In Guyana multiple discoveries have raised our estimate of recoverable resources to more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We are fast-tracking development and expect oil production to start in 2020. In another deepwater development area we increased our holdings to approximately 2.3 million net acres in Brazil’s pre-salt basins where we plan to start drilling in 2019.

Onshore we accelerated operations in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico building on our 2017 acquisition of high-quality contiguous acreage that will enable significant low-cost production growth.

Our investments in this prolific region remain profitable at 35 per barrel. Integration through transportation investments linking this production to our refining and chemical assets allows us to capture additional value – from the wellhead to the consumer.

And we are working to add additional low-cost production in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique where we are progressing new liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.

Our successes in Upstream development were recognized in 2018 by the World Oil and Gas Council when they honored ExxonMobil as “Explorer of the Year” – for the second consecutive year.

In our Downstream business we progressed six major refining investments all of which are advantaged versus industry. Three started up last year including the Beaumont hydrofiner the Antwerp delayed coker and the Rotterdam advanced hydrocracker. These Downstream investments deliver higher-value products and are expected to generate 20-percent returns.

In our Chemical business we moved forward on 13 new facilities to meet growing demand. Seven of these came online by the end of last year. The remaining six are on schedule. These investments enhanced by our technologies and global supply chain are expected to support 30-percent sales growth by 2025.

Across all of our operations we are committed to maintaining a safe work environment enriched by diversity and characterized by open communications and trust. We strive to continuously improve and achieve the highest standards of excellence in all that we do.

This includes upholding the highest standards of corporate citizenship. We maintain high ethical standards obey all applicable laws rules and regulations and respect local and national cultures.

We are also dedicated to reducing environmental impacts and managing the risks of climate change. Society faces a dual challenge: meeting growing energy needs while protecting the environment. ExxonMobil is playing our part by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and making products that help our customers limit theirs. We are also leading the way in developing low-carbon technologies like carbon capture and storage and advanced biofuels.

ExxonMobil’s story spans more than 135 years. From supplying the fuel and lubricants for the first airplane in the early 20th century to providing cleaner-burning natural gas to power entire cities today it has been a history of meeting our customers’ changing needs and expectations. It has been one of continual improvement and innovation. And it has been a record of creating significant value for our shareholders and for society.

Building on this history I believe the chapter we are writing today will be the most rewarding yet.

Today we are revising our guidance for Apple’s fiscal 2019 first quarter which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:
Revenue of approximately 84 billion
Gross margin of approximately 38 percent
Operating expenses of approximately 8.7 billion
Other income/(expense) of approximately 550 million
Tax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items
We expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.
Based on these estimates our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. 
While it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. 
When we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall we discussed four factors:
First we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max shipped in Q4’18—placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1’18 placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1’19 and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.
Second we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.
Third we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. Again this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.
Fourth we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. 
In addition these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. 
These last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I’d like to go a bit deeper on both. 
Emerging Market Challenges
While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in Greater China. In fact most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline occurred in Greater China across iPhone Mac and iPad.
China’s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets the effects appeared to reach consumers as well with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China’s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.
Despite these challenges we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.
iPhone
Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue primarily in Greater China accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact categories outside of iPhone (Services Mac iPad Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. 
While Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline in some developed markets iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies US dollar strength-related price increases and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. 
Many Positive Results in the December Quarter
While it’s disappointing to revise our guidance our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. 
Our installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high—growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before and it’s a testament to the ongoing loyalty satisfaction and engagement of our customers. 
Also as I mentioned earlier revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year including all-time record revenue from Services Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base not current period sales. 
Services generated over 10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.
Wearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. 
We also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries including the United States Canada Germany Italy Spain the Netherlands and Korea. And while we saw challenges in some emerging markets others set records including Mexico Poland Malaysia and Vietnam.
Finally we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple’s earnings per share.
Looking Ahead
Our profitability and cash flow generation are strong and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately 130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.
As we exit a challenging quarter we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach to take advantage of our culture of flexibility adaptability and creativity and to emerge better as a result. 
Most importantly we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth and we are not taking our foot off the gas.
We can’t change macroeconomic conditions but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores finance the purchase over time and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment it is great for the customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone and it is great for developers as it can help grow our installed base. 
This is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple’s strength is in our resilience the talent and creativity of our team and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.
Expectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.
That has always been the Apple way and it always will be.

4,Berkshire Hathaway,247837,3,242137,377000,Warren E. Buffett,Chairman President &  Chief Executive Officer,Financials,Insurance: Property and Casualty (Stock),25,Omaha,NE,41.2565369,-95.9345034,"To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:

Berkshire earned 4.0 billion in 2018 utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called ""GAAP""). The components of that figure are 24.8 billion in operating earnings a 3.0 billion non-cash loss from an impairment of intangible assets (arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz) 2.8 billion in realized capital gains from the sale of investment securities and a 20.6 billion loss from a reduction in the amount of unrealized capital gains that existed in our investment holdings.

A new GAAP rule requires us to include that last item in earnings. As I emphasized in the 2017 annual report neither Berkshire's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger nor I believe that rule to be sensible. Rather both of us have consistently thought that at Berkshire this mark-to-market change would produce what I described as ""wild and capricious swings in our bottom line.""

The accuracy of that prediction can be suggested by our quarterly results during 2018. In the first and fourth quarters we reported GAAP losses of 1.1 billion and 25.4 billion respectively. In the second and third quarters we reported profits of 12 billion and 18.5 billion. In complete contrast to these gyrations the many businesses that Berkshire owns delivered consistent and satisfactory operating earnings in all quarters.

For the year those earnings exceeded their 2016 high of 17.6 billion by 41%. Wide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That's because our huge equity portfolio -- valued at nearly 173 billion at the end of 2018 -- will often experience one-day price fluctuations of 2 billion or more all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line.

Indeed in the fourth quarter a period of high volatility in stock prices we experienced several days with a ""profit"" or ""loss"" of more than 4 billion. Our advice? Focus on operating earnings paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My saying that in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time Charlie and I expect them to deliver substantial gains albeit with highly irregular timing.

Long-time readers of our annual reports will have spotted the different way in which I opened this letter. For nearly three decades the initial paragraph featured the percentage change in Berkshire's per-share book value. It's now time to abandon that practice. The fact is that the annual change in Berkshire's book value -- which makes its farewell appearance on page 2 -- is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had.

Three circumstances have made that so. First Berkshire has gradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major value resides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner.

Second while our equity holdings are valued at market prices accounting rules require our collection of operating companies to be included in book value at an amount far below their current value a mismark that has grown in recent years. Third it is likely that -- over time -- Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares transactions that will take place at prices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value.

The math of such purchases is simple: Each transaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up while per-share book value goes down. That combination causes the book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality.

In future tabulations of our financial results we expect to focus on Berkshire's market price. Markets can be extremely capricious: Just look at the 54-year history laid out on page 2.

Over time however Berkshire's stock price will provide the best measure of business performance.

Before moving on I want to give you some good news -- really good news -- that is not reflected in our financial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018 when Ajit Jain was put in charge of all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations.

These moves were overdue. Berkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents and Berkshire blood flows through their veins.

Now let's take a look at what you own.

Focus on the Forest -- Forget the Trees
Investors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses -- our economic ""trees"" so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing given that we own a vast array of specimens ranging from twigs to redwoods.

A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade from now. Many others though are destined to grow in size and beauty.

Fortunately it's not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire's intrinsic business value. That's because our forest contains five ""groves"" of major importance each of which can be appraised with reasonable accuracy in its entirety.

Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses and financial assets that are easy to understand. The fifth -- our huge and diverse insurance operation -- delivers great value to Berkshire in a less obvious manner one I will explain later in this letter.

Before we look more closely at the first four groves let me remind you of our prime goal in the deployment of your capital: to buy ably-managed businesses in whole or part that possess favorable and durable economic characteristics. We also need to make these purchases at sensible prices.

Sometimes we can buy control of companies that meet our tests. Far more often we find the attributes we seek in publicly-traded businesses in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest.

Our two-pronged approach to huge-scale capital allocation is rare in corporate America and at times gives us an important advantage. In recent years the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for our money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety.

That disparity led us to buy about 43 billion of marketable equities last year while selling only 19 billion. Charlie and I believe the companies in which we invested offered excellent value far exceeding that available in takeover transactions.

Despite our recent additions to marketable equities the most valuable grove in Berkshire's forest remains the many dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with less than 80%). Those subsidiaries earned 16.8 billion last year.

When we say ""earned"" moreover we are describing what remains after all income taxes interest payments managerial compensation (whether cash or stock-based) restructuring expenses depreciation amortization and home-office overhead.

That brand of earnings is a far cry from that frequently touted by Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs. Too often their presentations feature ""adjusted EBITDA"" a measure that redefines ""earnings"" to exclude a variety of all-too-real costs.

For example managements sometimes assert that their company's stock-based compensation shouldn't be counted as an expense. (What else could it be -- a gift from shareholders?)

And restructuring expenses? Well maybe last year's exact rearrangement won't recur. But restructurings of one sort or another are common in business -- Berkshire has gone down that road dozens of times and our shareholders have always borne the costs of doing so.

Abraham Lincoln once posed the question: ""If you call a dog's tail a leg how many legs does it have?"" and then answered his own query: ""Four because calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one.""

Abe would have felt lonely on Wall Street. Charlie and I do contend that our acquisition-related amortization expenses of 1.4 billion (detailed on page K-84) are not a true economic cost. We add back such amortization ""costs"" to GAAP earnings when we are evaluating both private businesses and marketable stocks.

In contrast Berkshire's 8.4 billion depreciation charge understates our true economic cost. In fact we need to spend more than this sum annually to simply remain competitive in our many operations.

Beyond those ""maintenance"" capital expenditures we spend large sums in pursuit of growth. Overall Berkshire invested a record 14.5 billion last year in plant equipment and other fixed assets with 89% of that spent in America.

Berkshire's runner-up grove by value is its collection of equities typically involving a 5% to 10% ownership position in a very large company. As noted earlier our equity investments were worth nearly 173 billion at year end an amount far above their cost. If the portfolio had been sold at its yearend valuation federal income tax of about 14.7 billion would have been payable on the gain.

In all likelihood we will hold most of these stocks for a long time. Eventually however gains generate taxes at whatever rate prevails at the time of sale.

Our investees paid us dividends of 3.8 billion last year a sum that will increase in 2019. Far more important than the dividends though are the huge earnings that are annually retained by these companies.

Consider as an indicator these figures that cover only our five largest holdings:

Year-end Ownership / Berkshire's Share in  millions of Company Dividends / Retained Earnings ( millions):

American Express: 17.9% / 237 / 997

Apple: 5.4% / 745 / 2502

Bank of America: 9.5% /551 / 2096

Coca-Cola: 9.4% / 624

Wells Fargo: 9.8% /809 / 1263

Total: 2966 / 6837

GAAP -- which dictates the earnings we report -- does not allow us to include the retained earnings of investees in our financial accounts. But those earnings are of enormous value to us: Over the years earnings retained by our investees (viewed as a group) have eventually delivered capital gains to Berkshire that totaled more than one dollar for each dollar these companies reinvested for us.

All of our major holdings enjoy excellent economics and most use a portion of their retained earnings to repurchase their shares. We very much like that: If Charlie and I think an investee's stock is underpriced we rejoice when management employs some of its earnings to increase Berkshire's ownership percentage.

Here's one example drawn from the table above: Berkshire's holdings of American Express have remained unchanged over the past eight years. Meanwhile our ownership increased from 12.6% to 17.9% because of repurchases made by the company.

Last year Berkshire's portion of the 6.9 billion earned by American Express was 1.2 billion about 96% of the 1.3 billion we paid for our stake in the company. When earnings increase and shares outstanding decrease owners -- over time -- usually do well.

A third category of Berkshire's business ownership is a quartet of companies in which we share control with other parties. Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses -- 26.7% of Kraft Heinz 50% of Berkadia and Electric Transmission Texas and 38.6% of Pilot Flying J -- totaled about 1.3 billion in 2018.

In our fourth grove Berkshire held 112 billion at year end in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents and another 20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to be untouchable having pledged to always hold at least 20 billion in cash equivalents to guard against external calamities.

We have also promised to avoid any activities that could threaten our maintaining that buffer. Berkshire will forever remain a financial fortress.

In managing I will make expensive mistakes of commission and will also miss many opportunities some of which should have been obvious to me. At times our stock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash.

In the years ahead we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will permanently own. The immediate prospects for that however are not good: Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects. That disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable equities.

We continue nevertheless to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95 -- I'm the young one -- that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie's to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a huge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)

My expectation of more stock purchases is not a market call. Charlie and I have no idea as to how stocks will behave next week or next year.

Predictions of that sort have never been a part of our activities. Our thinking rather is focused on calculating whether a portion of an attractive business is worth more than its market price. I believe Berkshire's intrinsic value can be approximated by summing the values of our four asset-laden groves and then subtracting an appropriate amount for taxes eventually payable on the sale of marketable securities.

You may ask whether an allowance should not also be made for the major tax costs Berkshire would incur if we were to sell certain of our wholly-owned businesses. Forget that thought: It would be foolish for us to sell any of our wonderful companies even if no tax would be payable on its sale.

Truly good businesses are exceptionally hard to find. Selling any you are lucky enough to own makes no sense at all.

The interest cost on all of our debt has been deducted as an expense in calculating the earnings at Berkshire's non-insurance businesses. Beyond that much of our ownership of the first four groves is financed by funds generated from Berkshire's fifth grove -- a collection of exceptional insurance companies.

We call those funds ""float"" a source of financing that we expect to be cost-free -- or maybe even better than that -- over time. We will explain the characteristics of float later in this letter.

Finally a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire's value is maximized by our having assembled the five groves into a single entity. This arrangement allows us to seamlessly and objectively allocate major amounts of capital eliminate enterprise risk avoid insularity fund assets at exceptionally low cost occasionally take advantage of tax efficiencies and minimize overhead.

At Berkshire the whole is greater -- considerably greater -- than the sum of the parts.

Repurchases and Reporting
Earlier I mentioned that Berkshire will from time to time be repurchasing its own stock. Assuming that we buy at a discount to Berkshire's intrinsic value -- which certainly will be our intention -- repurchases will benefit both those shareholders leaving the company and those who stay.

True the upside from repurchases is very slight for those who are leaving. That's because careful buying by us will minimize any impact on Berkshire's stock price.

Nevertheless there is some benefit to sellers in having an extra buyer in the market. For continuing shareholders the advantage is obvious: If the market prices a departing partner's interest at say 90 cents on the dollar continuing shareholders reap an increase in per-share intrinsic value with every repurchase by the company.

Obviously repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is value destructive a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic CEOs. When a company says that it contemplates repurchases it's vital that all shareholder-partners be given the information they need to make an intelligent estimate of value.

Providing that information is what Charlie and I try to do in this report. We do not want a partner to sell shares back to the company because he or she has been misled or inadequately informed.

Some sellers however may disagree with our calculation of value and others may have found investments that they consider more attractive than Berkshire shares. Some of that second group will be right: There are unquestionably many stocks that will deliver far greater gains than ours.

In addition certain shareholders will simply decide it's time for them or their families to become net consumers rather than continuing to build capital. Charlie and I have no current interest in joining that group. Perhaps we will become big spenders in our old age.

For 54 years our managerial decisions at Berkshire have been made from the viewpoint of the shareholders who are staying not those who are leaving. Consequently Charlie and I have never focused on current-quarter results.

Berkshire in fact may be the only company in the Fortune 500 that does not prepare monthly earnings reports or balance sheets. I of course regularly view the monthly financial reports of most subsidiaries. But Charlie and I learn of Berkshire's overall earnings and financial position only on a quarterly basis.

Furthermore Berkshire has no company-wide budget (though many of our subsidiaries find one useful). Our lack of such an instrument means that the parent company has never had a quarterly ""number"" to hit. Shunning the use of this bogey sends an important message to our many managers reinforcing the culture we prize.

Over the years Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior both accounting and operational induced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations. What starts as an ""innocent"" fudge in order to not disappoint ""the Street"" -- say trade-loading at quarter-end turning a blind eye to rising insurance losses or drawing down a ""cookie-jar"" reserve -- can become the first step toward full-fledged fraud.

Playing with the numbers ""just this once"" may well be the CEO's intent; it's seldom the end result. And if it's okay for the boss to cheat a little it's easy for subordinates to rationalize similar behavior.

At Berkshire our audience is neither analysts nor commentators: Charlie and I are working for our shareholder-partners. The numbers that flow up to us will be the ones we send on to you.

Non-Insurance Operations -- From Lollipops to Locomotives
Let's now look further at Berkshire's most valuable grove -- our collection of non-insurance businesses -- keeping in mind that we do not wish to unnecessarily hand our competitors information that might be useful to them. Additional details about individual operations can be found on pages K-5 - K-22 and pages K-40 - K-51.

Viewed as a group these businesses earned pre-tax income in 2018 of 20.8 billion a 24% increase over 2017. Acquisitions we made in 2018 delivered only a trivial amount of that gain.

I will stick with pre-tax figures in this discussion. But our after-tax gain in 2018 from these businesses was far greater -- 47% -- thanks in large part to the cut in the corporate tax rate that became effective at the beginning of that year.

Let's look at why the impact was so dramatic. Begin with an economic reality: Like it or not the U.S. Government ""owns"" an interest in Berkshire's earnings of a size determined by Congress.

In effect our country's Treasury Department holds a special class of our stock -- call this holding the AA shares -- that receives large ""dividends"" (that is tax payments) from Berkshire. In 2017 as in many years before the corporate tax rate was 35% which meant that the Treasury was doing very well with its AA shares. Indeed the Treasury's ""stock"" which was paying nothing when we took over in 1965 had evolved into a holding that delivered billions of dollars annually to the federal government.

Last year however 40% of the government's ""ownership"" (14/35ths) was returned to Berkshire -- free of charge -- when the corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%. Consequently our ""A"" and ""B"" shareholders received a major boost in the earnings attributable to their shares.

This happening materially increased the intrinsic value of the Berkshire shares you and I own. The same dynamic moreover enhanced the intrinsic value of almost all of the stocks Berkshire holds.

Those are the headlines. But there are other factors to consider that tempered our gain. For example the tax benefits garnered by our large utility operation get passed along to its customers.

Meanwhile the tax rate applicable to the substantial dividends we receive from domestic corporations is little changed at about 13%. (This lower rate has long been logical because our investees have already paid tax on the earnings that they pay to us.)

Overall however the new law made our businesses and the stocks we own considerably more valuable. Which suggests that we return to the performance of our non-insurance businesses.

Our two towering redwoods in this grove are BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (90.9% owned). Combined they earned 9.3 billion before tax last year up 6% from 2017. You can read more about these businesses on pages K-5 - K-10 and pages K-40 - K-45.

Our next five non-insurance subsidiaries as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically) Clayton Homes International Metalworking Lubrizol Marmon and Precision Castparts had aggregate pre-tax income in 2018 of 6.4 billion up from the 5.5 billion these companies earned in 2017. The next five similarly ranked and listed (Forest River Johns Manville MiTek Shaw and TTI) earned 2.4 billion pre-tax last year up from 2.1 billion in 2017.

The remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns -- and there are many -- had pre-tax income of 3.6 billion in 2018 vs. 3.3 billion in 2017.

Insurance ""Float"" and the Funding of Berkshire Our property/casualty (""P/C"") insurance business -- our fifth grove -- has been the engine propelling Berkshire's growth since 1967 the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company National Fire & Marine for 8.6 million. Today National Indemnity is the largest property/casualty company in the world as measured by net worth.

One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry's business model: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later.

In extreme cases such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos or severe workplace accidents payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums -- money we call ""float"" -- that will eventually go to others.

Meanwhile insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently as our business grows so does our float.

And how it has grown as the following table shows:

Year / Float (in millions)*

1970 / 39

1980 / 237

1990 / 1632

2000 / 27871

2010 / 65832

2018 / 122732

* Includes float arising from life annuity and health insurance businesses.

We may in time experience a decline in float. If so the decline will be very gradual -- at the outside no more than 3% in any year.

The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies.

That strength will never be compromised. If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses our insurance operation registers an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned we enjoy the use of free money -- and better yet get paid for holding it.

Unfortunately the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition so vigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. That loss in effect is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry despite the float income all its companies enjoy will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses.

Nevertheless I like our own prospects. Berkshire's unrivaled financial strength allows us far more flexibility in investing our float than that generally available to P/C companies.

The many alternatives available to us are always an advantage and occasionally offer major opportunities. When other insurers are constrained our choices expand.

Moreover our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 15 of the past 16 years the exception being 2017 when our pre-tax loss was 3.2 billion.

For the entire 16-year span our pre-tax gain totaled 27 billion of which 2 billion was recorded in 2018. That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers who know that the benefits of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results.

All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion Old Testament style.

In most cases the funding of a business comes from two sources -- debt and equity. At Berkshire we have two additional arrows in the quiver to talk about but let's first address the conventional components.

We use debt sparingly. Many managers it should be noted will disagree with this policy arguing that significant debt juices the returns for equity owners. And these more venturesome CEOs will be right most of the time. At rare and unpredictable intervals however credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal.

A ""Russian Roulette"" equation -- usually win occasionally die -- may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company's upside but does not share in its downside. But that strategy would be madness for Berkshire. Rational people don't risk what they have and need for what they don't have and don't need.

Most of the debt you see on our consolidated balance sheet -- see page K-65 -- resides at our railroad and energy subsidiaries both of them asset-heavy companies. During recessions the cash generation of these businesses remains bountiful.

The debt they use is both appropriate for their operations and not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our level of equity capital is a different story: Berkshire's 349 billion is unmatched in corporate America.

By retaining all earnings for a very long time and allowing compound interest to work its magic we have amassed funds that have enabled us to purchase and develop the valuable groves earlier described. Had we instead followed a 100% payout policy we would still be working with the 22 million with which we began fiscal 1965.

Beyond using debt and equity Berkshire has benefitted in a major way from two less-common sources of corporate funding.

The larger is the float I have described. So far those funds though they are recorded as a huge net liability on our balance sheet have been of more utility to us than an equivalent amount of equity. That's because they have usually been accompanied by underwriting earnings.

In effect we have been paid in most years for holding and using other people's money. As I have often done before I will emphasize that this happy outcome is far from a sure thing: Mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years to surface. (Think asbestos.)

A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael will occur -- perhaps tomorrow perhaps many decades from now. ""The Big One"" may come from a traditional source such as a hurricane or earthquake or it may be a total surprise involving say a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate.

When such a mega-catastrophe strikes we will get our share of the losses and they will be big -- very big. Unlike many other insurers however we will be looking to add business the next day.

The final funding source -- which again Berkshire possesses to an unusual degree -- is deferred income taxes. These are liabilities that we will eventually pay but that are meanwhile interest-free.

As I indicated earlier about 14.7 billion of our 50.5 billion of deferred taxes arises from the unrealized gains in our equity holdings. These liabilities are accrued in our financial statements at the current 21% corporate tax rate but will be paid at the rates prevailing when our investments are sold.

Between now and then we in effect have an interest-free ""loan"" that allows us to have more money working for us in equities than would otherwise be the case. A further 28.3 billion of deferred tax results from our being able to accelerate the depreciation of assets such as plant and equipment in calculating the tax we must currently pay.

The front-ended savings in taxes that we record gradually reverse in future years. We regularly purchase additional assets however. As long as the present tax law prevails this source of funding should trend upward.

Over time Berkshire's funding base -- that's the right-hand side of our balance sheet -- should grow primarily through the earnings we retain. Our job is to put the money retained to good use on the left-hand side by adding attractive assets.

GEICO and Tony Nicely
That title says it all: The company and the man are inseparable.

Tony joined GEICO in 1961 at the age of 18; I met him in the mid-1970s. At that time GEICO after a four decade record of both rapid growth and outstanding underwriting results suddenly found itself near bankruptcy.

A recently installed management had grossly underestimated GEICO's loss costs and consequently underpriced its product. It would take many months until those loss-generating policies on GEICO's books -- there were no less than 2.3 million of them -- would expire and could then be repriced. The company's net worth in the meantime was rapidly approaching zero.

In 1976 Jack Byrne was brought in as CEO to rescue GEICO. Soon after his arrival I met him concluded that he was the perfect man for the job and began to aggressively buy GEICO shares. Within a few months Berkshire bought about one-third of the company a portion that later grew to roughly one-half without our spending a dime.

That stunning accretion occurred because GEICO after recovering its health consistently repurchased its shares. All told this half-interest in GEICO cost Berkshire 47 million about what you might pay today for a trophy apartment in New York.

Let's now fast-forward 17 years to 1993 when Tony Nicely was promoted to CEO. At that point GEICO's reputation and profitability had been restored -- but not its growth.

Indeed at year-end 1992 the company had only 1.9 million auto policies on its books far less than its pre-crisis high. In sales volume among U.S. auto insurers GEICO then ranked an undistinguished seventh.

ate in 1995 after Tony had re-energized GEICO Berkshire made an offer to buy the remaining 50% of the company for 2.3 billion about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!). Our offer was successful and brought Berkshire a wonderful but underdeveloped company and an equally wonderful CEO who would move GEICO forward beyond my dreams.

GEICO is now America's No. 2 auto insurer with sales 1200% greater than it recorded in 1995. Underwriting profits have totaled 15.5 billion (pre-tax) since our purchase and float available for investment has grown from 2.5 billion to 22.1 billion.

By my estimate Tony's management of GEICO has increased Berkshire's intrinsic value by more than 50 billion. On top of that he is a model for everything a manager should be helping his 40000 associates to identify and polish abilities they didn't realize they possessed.

Last year Tony decided to retire as CEO and on June 30 he turned that position over to Bill Roberts his long-time partner. I've known and watched Bill operate for several decades and once again Tony made the right move.

Tony remains chairman and will be helpful to GEICO for the rest of his life. He's incapable of doing less. All Berkshire shareholders owe Tony their thanks. I head the list.

Investments
Below we list our 15 common-stock investments that at year end had the largest market value. We exclude our Kraft Heinz holding -- 325442152 shares -- because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore must account for this i"

Something strange and remarkable has happened over the last 20 years. Take a look at these numbers:

1999 3% 2000 3% 2001 6% 2002 17% 2003 22% 2004 25% 2005 28% 2006 28% 2007 29% 2008 30% 2009 31% 2010 34% 2011 38% 2012 42% 2013 46% 2014 49% 2015 51% 2016 54% 2017 56% 2018 58%

The percentages represent the share of physical gross merchandise sales sold on Amazon by independent third-party sellers – mostly small- and medium-sized businesses – as opposed to Amazon retail’s own first party sales. Third-party sales have grown from 3% of the total to 58%. To put it bluntly:

Third-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly.

And it’s a high bar too because our first-party business has grown dramatically over that period from 1.6 billion in 1999 to 117 billion this past year. The compound annual growth rate for our first-party business in that time period is 25%. But in that same time third-party sales have grown from 0.1 billion to 160 billion – a compound annual growth rate of 52%. To provide an external benchmark eBay’s gross merchandise sales in that period have grown at a compound rate of 20% from 2.8 billion to 95 billion.

Why did independent sellers do so much better selling on Amazon than they did on eBay? And why were independent sellers able to grow so much faster than Amazon’s own highly organized first-party sales organization? There isn’t one answer but we do know one extremely important part of the answer:

We helped independent sellers compete against our first-party business by investing in and offering them the very best selling tools we could imagine and build. There are many such tools including tools that help sellers manage inventory process payments track shipments create reports and sell across borders – and we’re inventing more every year. But of great importance are Fulfillment by Amazon and the Prime membership program. In combination these two programs meaningfully improved the customer experience of buying from independent sellers. With the success of these two programs now so well established it’s difficult for most people to fully appreciate today just how radical those two offerings were at the time we launched them. We invested in both of these programs at significant financial risk and after much internal debate. We had to continue investing significantly over time as we experimented with different ideas and iterations. We could not foresee with certainty what those programs would eventually look like let alone whether they would succeed but they were pushed forward with intuition and heart and nourished with optimism.

Intuition curiosity and the power of wandering

From very early on in Amazon’s life we knew we wanted to create a culture of builders – people who are curious explorers. They like to invent. Even when they’re experts they are “fresh” with a beginner’s mind. They see the way we do things as just the way we do things now. A builder’s mentality helps us approach big hard-to-solve opportunities with a humble conviction that success can come through iteration: invent launch reinvent relaunch start over rinse repeat again and again. They know the path to success is anything but straight.

Sometimes (often actually) in business you do know where you’re going and when you do you can be efficient. Put in place a plan and execute. In contrast wandering in business is not efficient … but it’s also not random. It’s guided – by hunch gut intuition curiosity and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that it’s worth being a little messy and tangential to find our way there. Wandering is an essential counter-balance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outsized discoveries – the “non-linear” ones – are highly likely to require wandering.

AWS’s millions of customers range from startups to large enterprises government entities to nonprofits each looking to build better solutions for their end users. We spend a lot of time thinking about what those organizations want and what the people inside them – developers dev managers ops managers CIOs chief digital officers chief information security officers etc. – want.

Much of what we build at AWS is based on listening to customers. It’s critical to ask customers what they want listen carefully to their answers and figure out a plan to provide it thoughtfully and quickly (speed matters in business!). No business could thrive without that kind of customer obsession. But it’s also not enough. The biggest needle movers will be things that customers don’t know to ask for. We must invent on their behalf. We have to tap into our own inner imagination about what’s possible.

AWS itself – as a whole – is an example. No one asked for AWS. No one. Turns out the world was in fact ready and hungry for an offering like AWS but didn’t know it. We had a hunch followed our curiosity took the necessary financial risks and began building – reworking experimenting and iterating countless times as we proceeded.

Within AWS that same pattern has recurred many times. For example we invented DynamoDB a highly scalable low latency key-value database now used by thousands of AWS customers. And on the listening-carefully-to-customers side we heard loudly that companies felt constrained by their commercial database options and had been unhappy with their database providers for decades – these offerings are expensive proprietary have high-lock-in and punitive licensing terms. We spent several years building our own database engine Amazon Aurora a fully-managed MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible service with the same or better durability and availability as the commercial engines but at one-tenth of the cost. We were not surprised when this worked.

But we’re also optimistic about specialized databases for specialized workloads. Over the past 20 to 30 years companies ran most of their workloads using relational databases. The broad familiarity with relational databases among developers made this technology the go-to even when it wasn’t ideal. Though sub-optimal the data set sizes were often small enough and the acceptable query latencies long enough that you could make it work. But today many applications are storing very large amounts of data – terabytes and petabytes. And the requirements for apps have changed. Modern applications are driving the need for low latencies real-time processing and the ability to process millions of requests per second. It’s not just key-value stores like DynamoDB but also in-memory databases like Amazon ElastiCache time series databases like Amazon Timestream and ledger solutions like Amazon Quantum Ledger Database – the right tool for the right job saves money and gets your product to market faster.

We’re also plunging into helping companies harness Machine Learning. We’ve been working on this for a long time and as with other important advances our initial attempts to externalize some of our early internal Machine Learning tools were failures. It took years of wandering – experimentation iteration and refinement as well as valuable insights from our customers – to enable us to find SageMaker which launched just 18 months ago. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting complexity and guesswork from each step of the machine learning process – democratizing AI. Today thousands of customers are building machine learning models on top of AWS with SageMaker. We continue to enhance the service including by adding new reinforcement learning capabilities. Reinforcement learning has a steep learning curve and many moving parts which has largely put it out of reach of all but the most well-funded and technical organizations until now. None of this would be possible without a culture of curiosity and a willingness to try totally new things on behalf of customers. And customers are responding to our customer-centric wandering and listening – AWS is now a 30 billion annual run rate business and growing fast.

Imagining the impossible

Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that’s largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline in brick and mortar stores. For many years we considered how we might serve customers in physical stores but felt we needed first to invent something that would really delight customers in that environment. With Amazon Go we had a clear vision. Get rid of the worst thing about physical retail: checkout lines. No one likes to wait in line. Instead we imagined a store where you could walk in pick up what you wanted and leave.

Getting there was hard. Technically hard. It required the efforts of hundreds of smart dedicated computer scientists and engineers around the world. We had to design and build our own proprietary cameras and shelves and invent new computer vision algorithms including the ability to stitch together imagery from hundreds of cooperating cameras. And we had to do it in a way where the technology worked so well that it simply receded into the background invisible. The reward has been the response from customers who’ve described the experience of shopping at Amazon Go as “magical.” We now have 10 stores in Chicago San Francisco and Seattle and are excited about the future.

Failure needs to scale too

As a company grows everything needs to scale including the size of your failed experiments. If the size of your failures isn’t growing you’re not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle. Amazon will be experimenting at the right scale for a company of our size if we occasionally have multibillion-dollar failures. Of course we won’t undertake such experiments cavalierly. We will work hard to make them good bets but not all good bets will ultimately pay out. This kind of large-scale risk taking is part of the service we as a large company can provide to our customers and to society. The good news for shareowners is that a single big winning bet can more than cover the cost of many losers.

Development of the Fire phone and Echo was started around the same time. While the Fire phone was a failure we were able to take our learnings (as well as the developers) and accelerate our efforts building Echo and Alexa. The vision for Echo and Alexa was inspired by the Star Trek computer. The idea also had origins in two other arenas where we’d been building and wandering for years: machine learning and the cloud. From Amazon’s early days machine learning was an essential part of our product recommendations and AWS gave us a front row seat to the capabilities of the cloud. After many years of development Echo debuted in 2014 powered by Alexa who lives in the AWS cloud.

No customer was asking for Echo. This was definitely us wandering. Market research doesn’t help. If you had gone to a customer in 2013 and said “Would you like a black always-on cylinder in your kitchen about the size of a Pringles can that you can talk to and ask questions that also turns on your lights and plays music?” I guarantee you they’d have looked at you strangely and said “No thank you.”

Since that first-generation Echo customers have purchased more than 100 million Alexa-enabled devices. Last year we improved Alexa’s ability to understand requests and answer questions by more than 20% while adding billions of facts to make Alexa more knowledgeable than ever. Developers doubled the number of Alexa skills to over 80000 and customers spoke to Alexa tens of billions more times in 2018 compared to 2017. The number of devices with Alexa built-in more than doubled in 2018. There are now more than 150 different products available with Alexa built-in from headphones and PCs to cars and smart home devices. Much more to come!

One last thing before closing. As I said in the first shareholder letter more than 20 years ago our focus is on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees who can think like owners. Achieving that requires investing in our employees and as with so many other things at Amazon we use not just analysis but also intuition and heart to find our way forward.

Last year we raised our minimum wage to 15-an-hour for all full-time part-time temporary and seasonal employees across the U.S. This wage hike benefitted more than 250000 Amazon employees as well as over 100000 seasonal employees who worked at Amazon sites across the country last holiday. We strongly believe that this will benefit our business as we invest in our employees. But that is not what drove the decision. We had always offered competitive wages. But we decided it was time to lead – to offer wages that went beyond competitive. We did it because it seemed like the right thing to do.

Today I challenge our top retail competitors (you know who you are!) to match our employee benefits and our 15 minimum wage. Do it! Better yet go to 16 and throw the gauntlet back at us. It’s a kind of competition that will benefit everyone.

Many of the other programs we have introduced for our employees came as much from the heart as the head. I’ve mentioned before the Career Choice program which pays up to 95% of tuition and fees towards a certificate or diploma in qualified fields of study leading to in-demand careers for our associates even if those careers take them away from Amazon. More than 16000 employees have now taken advantage of the program which continues to grow. Similarly our Career Skills program trains hourly associates in critical job skills like resume writing how to communicate effectively and computer basics. In October of last year in continuation of these commitments we signed the President’s Pledge to America’s Workers and announced we will be upskilling 50000 U.S. employees through our range of innovative training programs.

Our investments are not limited to our current employees or even to the present. To train tomorrow’s workforce we have pledged 50 million including through our recently announced Amazon Future Engineer program to support STEM and CS education around the country for elementary high school and university students with a particular focus on attracting more girls and minorities to these professions. We also continue to take advantage of the incredible talents of our veterans. We are well on our way to meeting our pledge to hire 25000 veterans and military spouses by 2021. And through the Amazon Technical Veterans Apprenticeship program we are providing veterans on-the-job training in fields like cloud computing.

A huge thank you to our customers for allowing us to serve you while always challenging us to do even better to our shareowners for your continuing support and to all our employees worldwide for your hard work and pioneering spirit. Teams all across Amazon are listening to customers and wandering on their behalf!

As always I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. It remains Day 1.

McKesson’s mission of delivering better health is what drives our 78000+ employees each and every day. Through
our work with partners across the healthcare ecosystem we play an integral role in helping people live healthier more
productive lives.
In Fiscal 2018 our Company delivered solid performance across many of our businesses. Despite some industry-wide
headwinds we produced strong returns and invested to enhance our ability to deliver value to our manufacturing
partners our customers and patients.
The Company generated revenues of 208.4 billion compared to 198.5 billion in Fiscal 2017 and produced adjusted
earnings of 12.62 per diluted share compared to 12.54 in Fiscal 2017.
Most important we positioned ourselves to lead in areas of patient-care delivery that present powerful new growth
opportunities. Our recently announced Multi-Year Strategic Growth Initiative articulates a clear path for McKesson in
areas such as specialty pharmaceuticals and manufacturer services which are poised for the next significant wave of
healthcare innovation.
We are also streamlining our Company with a focus on improving our cost position and agility. Every major function
has set a three-year path driven by recent reorganizations to accomplish a new more focused and efficient company.
We believe this initiative will produce accelerated long-term growth for shareholders while improving our overall
business performance and enabling us to deliver more value to our partners and customers. The healthcare industry
continues to evolve and McKesson is more focused and growth-driven than ever. Our future and promise as a leader
in healthcare is outstanding.
Pivoting to the Patient
Throughout our history McKesson has constantly evolved in response to changing customer needs and market dynamics.
Over the past decade we have focused on rapidly expanding segments of healthcare while directing our businesses
toward higher-margin offerings within areas where we provide the most value.
Our new Multi-Year Strategic Growth Initiative reflects our vision of healthcare’s future and the leadership role we can
play in helping patients get the pharmaceutical treatments and care they need while our partners and customers along
the supply chain benefit from our insights and collaboration.
In simple terms our strategic growth initiative is about expanding the value we create throughout the supply chain to
improve patient care and drive incremental long-term earnings growth. To that end we are sharpening our focus on our
core distribution businesses and honing in on the following priorities:
• Expanding our value proposition to manufacturers
• Enhancing our solutions to support the specialty drug pipeline
• Evolving the current retail pharmacy model to expand the role of the pharmacist as a provider of care through an
 omnichannel experience
• Leveraging sophisticated data and analytics capabilities to support our customers partners and patients
In addition to pursuing these specific opportunities we have begun to streamline processes lower costs create more
efficiencies and better align our operations. The savings will be largely reinvested to support our growth objectives.
Enhancing Value for Our Partners
Fundamentally McKesson has always been a wholesaler serving as a conduit between the pharmaceutical innovations
and the needs of care providers. Ultimately we help patients get the treatment and care they need.
Adjusted
earnings per
diluted share
208
billion
Total revenues
12.62 
Our job at the center of that supply chain has been to be world class and highly efficient in delivering competitive
pricing at scale while expanding our value upstream and downstream through technology services data and analytics
and solutions.
Upstream the complexity of bringing products to market requires an integrated approach which we are uniquely
able to provide. For example to launch a new therapy today’s biopharma companies must prove clinical effectiveness
establish reasonable reimbursement terms with payers form relationships with prescribers find the right patients
and prove successful outcomes with patients. Our solutions support manufacturers in getting their products to market
more quickly and providing them with evidence of effectiveness while ensuring patients can access innovative therapies
and helping them adhere to those therapies long term.
Our US Oncology Network illustrates the crucial role we play. Over 30% of new approved oncology drugs have gone
through our clinical trials. We are the only organization through which manufacturers can apply their specialty therapies
to the patient populations that need them most while participating in a data-based feedback loop that helps physicians
patients and manufacturers continue to improve efficacy adherence and outcomes.
We have made a number of strategic moves over the past 12 to 24 months to build value with our manufacturer partners.
These investments have brought new services and solutions that when combined with our existing offerings make us
a stronger partner for both our pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturer partners and our customers.
The addition of RxCrossroads as an example greatly enhances our commercialization solutions for manufacturers
of branded specialty generic and biosimilar drugs. And BDI Pharma complements our offerings in alternative side
channels and provides support to our manufacturer partners with increased scale and customer penetration.
We’ve also been strategic in the ways we collaborate to help create more value for our partners and our shareholders.
ClarusONE our generic sourcing joint venture with Walmart is a terrific example of this innovative approach to the
changing dynamics in healthcare. We’ve been extremely pleased with the business’s overall performance this year while
contracting with a diverse range of manufacturers. This has benefited all our customers who purchase generics through
us helping them be more successful in a competitive and dynamic market.
Helping Create Better Health for Patients
We support our customers’ patient care in a variety of settings — in emergency rooms ambulatory centers clinics and
pharmacies. We have our own retail pharmacies and affiliated oncology practices. And we offer practice management
solutions to make care providers more efficient and help create the best care experience and outcome for the patient.
Our acquisition of intraFUSION a provider of management services for physician office infusion centers is another
example of how we’re deploying our capital to strengthen our core businesses. IntraFUSION broadens our offerings to
community-based physician practices.
We also have a significant footprint in retail pharmacy with more than 16000 owned and banner pharmacies in North
America and Europe. Patients today seek the convenience of receiving care in a way that suits them whether online
or in person. Increasingly they will look to pharmacies for healthcare services they once sought from physicians such
as diabetes or hypertension management.
Our vision is to build a single platform for this omnichannel care experience so that customers can use our services
to receive pharmaceutical deliveries at home pick them up at a store do research online or consult with a pharmacist
in person. With our recent acquisition of Well.ca we have strengthened our e-commerce capabilities to provide an
omnichannel presence for customers.
Our strategic growth initiative is about expanding the
value we create throughout the supply chain to improve patient
“
care and drive incremental long-term earnings growth. ”
And our suite of retail pharmacy services is broad. We connect patients digitally with pharmacists to provide medication
education treatment protocols and medication scheduling reminders driving adherence across our global retail footprint.
Through RelayHealth Pharmacy we also collect data and provide analytics that help retail pharmacists manage
individual patients drive adherence and deliver better health outcomes.
Finally our Medical-Surgical business continues to be one of the fastest-growing businesses in our portfolio benefiting
from the industry-wide shift to lower sites of care. Our sales representatives have a deep understanding of the needs of
physicians hospitals and ambulatory clinics helping our partners improve the services they offer patients.
There is no doubt that the needs of our partners and our customers will continue to evolve as the needs of patients
and the healthcare system overall change. While reduced reimbursements and other economic pressures create challenges
across the industry we believe that low-cost settings of care are an important part of the solution to improving affordability
access and patient health.
We will also continue to find new ways to help our customers be more successful — both clinically and financially.
Whether it is through an innovative partnership like ClarusONE or a strategic investment like intraFUSION we are
focused on what’s ultimately most important: helping deliver better health.
Helping Fight the Opioid Epidemic
We are deeply concerned about the impact the opioid crisis is having on families and communities across the United
States. We have seen it touch the lives of McKesson employees our family members and neighbors. That’s why we have
focused tremendous energy and resources on helping fight the opioid epidemic.
As a pharmaceutical distributor we recognize that we operate as one component within the pharmaceutical supply
chain which also includes drug manufacturers regulatory bodies like the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
and state pharmacy boards insurance companies prescribing doctors and dispensing pharmacists.
In response to the epidemic we have invested millions of dollars to strengthen our anti-diversion program and are
actively supporting a set of solutions that we believe will help prevent diversion and misuse of opioids and other
commonly abused medications.
In partnership with others in the industry we are committed to developing and deploying tools and resources to help
minimize abuse combat overprescribing and increase doctor and patient education. In Fiscal 2018 we also committed
100 million to form a foundation dedicated to combatting the crisis.
We expect the foundation’s focus to be on improving education for patients caregivers and providers addressing key
policy issues and increasing access to life-saving treatments such as opioid overdose reversal medications.
Within McKesson we are also embarking on the following critical initiatives:
• A national prescription safety-alert system
We are developing a real-time workflow solution for pharmacists and providers that will flag patients at risk
of opioid abuse or misuse.
• E-prescribing
We are helping to transition customers to e-prescribing of opioids and will stop selling opioids to customers
who cannot process e-prescriptions of controlled substances during 2019.
• Limited dose packaging
We will work with manufacturing partners to develop plans for limited dose packaging to make it easier for
doctors to prescribe and pharmacists to dispense opioids in smaller doses.
• Fast-track distribution of new non-opioid pain medications
We will work with our manufacturing partners to help bring to market non-opioid pain medications as soon
as FDA approval has been secured.
• Pharmacist training on opioid overdose reversal medications
We are providing complimentary training to pharmacists developed by third-party experts on how to administer
opioid overdose reversal medications such as naloxone.
We will develop an annual report to track our progress on these initiatives and share our learnings and insights with
the public.
One of McKesson’s primary goals is to help ensure that medicines prescribed by licensed doctors are delivered to
licensed pharmacies so they are available for patients who need them when they need them and where they need
them. We are committed to being a responsible partner in the fight against prescription drug diversion while safely
delivering medicine for legitimate use to patients in need.
Our People and Culture
McKesson’s success is built on the foundation of our ICARE shared principles. These values are core to who we are and
help guide our priorities and decisions while reinforcing the highest standards of ethical behavior at every level. In
this environment our talented and passionate people thrive. They recognize that financial performance and creating
value for our investors are critical parts of our mission yet our truest measure of accomplishment is based on how
well we meet the needs of our customers including patients.
McKesson is proud to be ranked #1 as the World’s Most Admired Company in the Healthcare Wholesaler category by
Fortune Magazine voted among the Best Places to Work for LGBT individuals by HRC Corporate Equality Index and
recognized as a Military Friendly Employer by Military Friendly.
In our work we demonstrate our commitment to patients and their families every day and strive to be a great corporate
citizen. McKesson employees logged 25468 volunteer hours supported 1183 organizations added 2214 new bone
marrow donors to the national marrow registry and supported hurricane relief efforts and California wildfire relief
efforts among many other important causes.
People are inspired by many different things. Most are motivated by more than financial reward. At McKesson we have
a competitive (and friendly) culture and our employees enjoy being part of a winning organization. But we also have
a humble sense of service and know that we are privileged to work in an industry that cares for those in need.
A Bold Vision of Our Future
As a shareholder you should feel confident in the present and future of our Company.
Our array of strategic assets and solutions positions us extremely well against our competitors in every market. Our
operations are highly efficient and we have a strong financial position. Our employees are passionate about what they
do. In our distribution centers this ethic is articulated by our employees with the saying “It’s not a package it’s
a patient.” That powerful slogan reflects a deep understanding within our culture that patients and their families rely
on the work we do. It inspires us to do that work better each day. Our strategic growth initiative will deepen our focus
on patients and drive new growth. It will help us find better ways to work. It will help us improve lives.
The healthcare pipeline that we’ve built over the past 185 years continues to change and grow in innovative and
connective ways. Yet one principle remains the same: when the patient wins we all win.
On behalf of our entire Company thank you for your commitment to McKesson.

Today’s health care system faces a broad range of challenges from its complexity and lack of support for patients to a focus on episodic care in a fee-for-service environment. Moreover fragmentation among various stakeholders all too often leaves patients struggling to manage and coordinate their own care. These factors have led to unnecessary avoidable spending and inferior outcomes for patients. In fact research shows that up to 25 percent of the more than 2 trillion the United States spends annually on treating patients with chronic conditions is preventable.

I believe that CVS Health is best positioned to tackle these challenges and remake the consumer health care experience. Through our CVS Pharmacy® locations and unique suite of integrated assets we can open a new front door to health care that is both easier to use and less expensive. What are some of these assets? They include our CVS Caremark® pharmacy benefits business MinuteClinic®  Coram® infusion services Accordant® nurse care management and of course our transformative acquisition of Aetna® completed in November 2018.

Aetna acquisition creates multiple opportunities for medical cost savings and long-term growth
We continued to generate significant free cash flow and returned more than 2 billion to shareholders
Multiple drivers spurred PBM revenue gains as clients embraced new cost-saving options
In-store prescription volumes continued to rise while we also introduced new concept stores and pilot programs
GHG reductions anti-smoking initiatives and efforts at combating opioid addiction highlight our CSR commitments
In closing I want to thank our board of directors our shareholders and the more than 290000 colleagues who contribute on a daily basis to our work as health care innovators. If you haven’t already done so please take a few minutes to read the pages that preceded this letter to learn more about the extraordinary work we are doing to create a better health care experience for the patients and clients that we serve. We are developing a uniquely powerful new platform that will enable us to transform the consumer health care experience.

For more than a decade AT&T has successfully satisfied our customers’ exploding appetite
for mobile connectivity. Our significant investments over that time have driven our success
as we’ve led our industry through a global revolution in making the internet mobile. Today
we continue moving forward to deliver on the promise of those investments and create
additional value for you our shareholders.
We’re doing this at a time when the technology media and telecommunications sectors
are in the midst of a new revolution as consumers rapidly change how they engage with
content. As a truly modern media company AT&T is well-positioned to once again lead this
next revolution.
With our acquisition of Time Warner – now known as WarnerMedia – we have brought
together one of the best collections of premium video content a large base of direct-toconsumer relationships high-speed networks optimized for video and an advertising
technology platform that will make premium video advertising more relevant and valuable.
We believe this combination of capabilities has positioned us to thrive in the coming years
as both the communications and entertainment sectors undergo serious transformations
driven by new innovations in technology and changing customer demands.

In communications dramatic improvements in mobile technology are driving more
broadband and video consumption to smartphones and tablets. And as we roll out our
5G network – with an even faster and more responsive experience – those trends toward
mobility will only accelerate.
In entertainment the practice of setting aside time to watch particular TV programs is giving
way to on-demand streaming services with extensive libraries of content made readily
available behind easy-to-access user interfaces. As a result media companies that produce
shows and movies have recognized that they can no longer rely exclusively on wholesale
distribution of their content through satellite and cable companies. While those relationships
will continue to be important distribution channels media companies must also develop
direct consumer relationships for their content to reach the broadest possible audience.
Equally important in this shifting landscape of content and distribution are advertisers. They
are pleading for premium video advertising models that perform as well as digital models.
We intend to capitalize on this changing landscape as a modern media company built to
delight our customers with new services that can be delivered by a company with the new
assets and capabilities of AT&T.
It starts with more than 170 million direct-to-consumer relationships across our wireless
pay-TV and broadband businesses in the United States wireless in Mexico and DIRECTV in Latin
America. This number grows to more than 370 million when we include WarnerMedia’s digital
properties such as CNN.com Bleacher Report and Otter Media.
We are building a broad portfolio of video services to satisfy the media and entertainment
needs of every consumer from those who demand a premium 4K TV experience with extensive
sports and content libraries to those who are more price-conscious and want smaller packages
of content.

We’re also working on an exciting new premium subscription-video-on-demand service from
WarnerMedia that will draw on the rich and deep content libraries of HBO Warner Bros.
and Turner. We expect to introduce this service by the end of 2019 and we believe it will be a
compelling offer that drives significant demand.
This combination of premium video content and our direct-to-consumer relationships
provides us with a valuable resource: data-driven insights we can use to develop new
advertising models and make ads more relevant to consumers. Our newly formed advertising
technology company Xandr will add considerable new value to both our communications
and entertainment businesses.
Bringing together all these capabilities sets up a virtuous cycle: Great content drives
deeper customer engagement. Deeper engagement provides greater customer insights
into the content our customers enjoy. Those insights inform the creation of new content
and facilitate relevant targeted advertising that drives deeper engagement. And the
cycle repeats.
Premium content increases
consumer engagement.
Broad direct-to-consumer
relationships inform the creation
and curation of new content.
Advertising technology makes ads

overall experience for consumers
and advertisers alike.

needed to keep up with demand
for premium content.

We’re building this new kind of company on a strong foundation.
Here’s a high-level view:
AT&T’s profits and cash flow are largely driven by our Mobility business which last
year was recognized as having the #1 U.S. wireless network.¹ As you’ll see in the
chart below following the Time Warner acquisition nearly half of our company’s
EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) comes from
Mobility. We had a strong 2018 and that momentum has carried into this year as well.
In addition we’re ahead of schedule in our deployment of FirstNet the nationwide
network for first responders. And we’re leveraging this major infrastructure
investment as an opportunity to install 5G-capable radios on our cell towers. These
radios can be upgraded to 5G through a simple software update giving us a decided
speed and cost advantage as we scale our rollout of mobile 5G in the years to come.
Our next-largest business unit by EBITDA is WarnerMedia which also just came
off a strong year. On a comparable basis it grew revenues 5.5% and EBITDA 7%2
in 2018 thanks to solid performance from all three of its business units – Turner
Home Box Office and Warner Bros.
Business Wireline represents the services we sell to businesses. Quarter-in and
quarter-out it generates steady profit and cash flow. Revenues may fluctuate as big
business customers continue their migration to wireless and cloud-based services
but this business has consistently produced EBITDA in the 2.5 billion range in each
of the past 12 quarters.
The Entertainment Group is our video and broadband business. We’ve been
aggressively investing in the Entertainment Group for the past several years
including building out our fiber footprint. Our fiber deployment is driving
momentum in our broadband business. Fiber is the backbone of our network and
key to our plans for 5G. We’re on track to reach 22 million consumer and business
locations with fiber by the middle of 2019.

We’ve also been investing in our internet video streaming platforms – DIRECTV
NOW and WatchTV. We’ve worked diligently to get these offerings just right since
first introducing DIRECTV NOW in 2016 from managing content costs to optimizing
pricing to match customer value.
As a result of these initiatives we expect Entertainment Group EBITDA to be stable
in 2019.
Our Latin America business had a very solid 2018 and entered this year with a lot of
momentum. Vrio our TV business in Latin America continued to grow subscribers
and generate positive cash flow. In Mexico we added 3.2 million mobile subscribers
last year. Over the last 3½ years we’ve built a premier nationwide LTE network in
Mexico. We essentially completed that network build last year which lowers our
future capital requirements and gives us line of sight to positive EBITDA in Mexico in
the second half of 2019.
Finally Xandr – our newest business – is already contributing strong revenue
and EBITDA growth. It significantly deepened our data analytics capabilities with
the foundational acquisition of AppNexus and is now making good progress in
applying data-driven insights to make our advertising inventory more relevant
and valuable.
AT&T is not only growing today but is also well-positioned for the future. In 2019
we plan to invest about 23 billion of capital into our growth areas.5
 Even after making
those investments we expect to generate free cash flow in the 26 billion range this
year.6
 After paying more than 14 billion in dividends we expect to have about 12 billion of
discretionary cash flow. And that cash flow is earmarked for paying down our debt from the
Time Warner acquisition. We’ll be at a more comfortable net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio
in the 2.5x range by year-end 2019 and we will continue to de-lever after that.

We have put a lot of thought and energy into ensuring that our balance sheet is solid.
We’ve structured our debt to ensure that we have no outsized maturities for the next
five years. In addition we have locked in historically low fixed-interest rates on the vast
majority of our debt removing any significant exposure to interest rate swings. Our pension
liabilities are essentially fully funded and will require very little additional funding over the
next few years.
Rest assured our dividend remains an important way we return value to you our shareholders.
In December the board of directors approved an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend
for the 35th consecutive year. Even with that increase we expect our dividend payout ratio to
be in the high 50s% range of free cash flow this year.7
We expect to reach a 2.5 billion merger synergy run rate from WarnerMedia by year-end
2021. Since day one the merger has been accretive to earnings per share free cash flow and
dividend coverage.
Above all we’re confident in our ability to deliver on our 2019 priorities: pay down our debt
continue to invest in our growth areas and deliver a steady consistent dividend to you.
Our overall financial outlook for 2019 includes:8
Free cash flow in the 26 billion range;
Dividend payout ratio in the high 50s% range;
End-of-year net debt-to-EBITDA ratio on an adjusted basis in the 2.5x range;
Gross capital investment in the 23 billion range; and
Adjusted EPS growth in the low single digits.
We have the right assets and strategy for long-term sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving
marketplace. Our focus is on execution. Since we closed the Time Warner deal last June the
integration has gone well. We’ve brought together two companies with different cultures while
preserving the creative energy editorial independence and other unique qualities that made
Turner Home Box Office and Warner Bros. so attractive to us in the first place. We continue to
be a leader in the industry for creative leadership and talent and we intend to continue giving
them the freedom to keep doing what they do best.

As we build for the future we’ll continue to focus on running our company with the same

experiences that are effortless imaginative and innovative across our entire business and at
every customer touchpoint.
As we deliver those experiences our businesses will work together to unlock new value for
customers and investors. So we’ve organized the company to balance the need for autonomy
speed and agility with the power of collaboration and scale.
Beginning on page 12 we provide a look at each of our four businesses and their priorities
for 2019 and beyond.
We’ll also continue to grow as a truly data-powered company. We’ll find more and more ways
to effectively and responsibly use data to better serve our customers and innovate with new
services and business models. As we do that we’re committed to four privacy principles:
Being open and honest
about how we use your data.
Giving you choices about
how we use your data.
Using strong safeguards to keep

Managing data in a respectful

DRIVEN BY
OUR VALUES
In support of these principles we’re advocating for Congress to pass a law that champions
consumer privacy and promotes accountability; fosters innovation and competitiveness;
harmonizes regulations across federal and state jurisdictions; and works with the laws of
other countries to protect consumer privacy on a global scale.
Our values underpin everything we do. These core beliefs – listed on page 1 – unite our
people no matter where they work or live. We bring them to life in all that we do for our
customers and in our every interaction with one another. They also feed into our long-term
strategy to make a positive contribution to society as a responsible corporate citizen. That
role includes our commitment to the environment which we advanced in 2018 by becoming
one of the largest corporate purchasers of renewable energy in the U.S. investing in up to
820 megawatts of wind energy to date. That’s enough energy capacity to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions equivalent to taking more than 530000 cars off the road for one year. It’s just
one way we are working to achieve our goal to enable carbon savings 10 times the carbon
footprint of our operations by 2025.
Our Aspire and ESCUELA+ education programs are in their second decade of driving
innovation in education for underserved and underrepresented populations in the U.S. and
Latin America. We’re applying many of the tools and learnings from Aspire as we continue
to reskill our own global workforce for the future. Our reskilling program has been cited as a
national model. It has helped provide our employees and others with the skills they need for
the high-tech jobs of today and tomorrow.
We’re also focused on developing solutions for the challenges faced by the communities we
serve. Our strong belief that we can make a positive difference in our communities inspired
the launch of AT&T BELIEVESSM starting with Believe Chicago. It’s our effort to bring training
economic opportunity and hope to our fellow citizens in neighborhoods heavily impacted by
violence. We have also begun similar initiatives to create positive change in other local urban
communities across the country including Atlanta Dallas and New York.
Finally I am proud of our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce. WarnerMedia’s
new Diversity & Inclusion Policy announced in September is a pioneering media industry
commitment to give more opportunities to women people of color and individuals from
other underrepresented groups – both in front of and behind the camera.
We became one
of the largest
corporate buyers of
clean energy in the U.S.

that’s always been at the heart of AT&T. So it was no surprise that once again we saw our
employees repeatedly rise to the occasion in response to hurricanes floods wildfires and
blizzards – working around the clock to reconnect people and communities and report the
news. Simply put I know of no company anywhere that’s blessed with finer people.
I’m also grateful to our world-class board of directors for the wisdom perspective and
diversity of experience they bring to AT&T’s governance. They constantly push us challenge
our assumptions and make us view issues and opportunities from new angles. From our
strategy and business operations to our social responsibility initiatives we bring them our
plans and they make them better every time.Finally I want you to know how much our company and I have appreciated your support these
past few years as we aggressively invested in our businesses and networks acquired critical
new assets and worked for significant tax and regulatory reform. All of these elements have
laid the groundwork for the unique position we’re in today. I’m confident we have the right
assets the right strategy and the right team to execute on the opportunities ahead of us to
create value for you."

This year marks Chevron’s 140th anniversary – a milestone that prompts reflection on our history and admiration for the extraordinary women and men who have built a lasting company based on the belief that energy is vital to human progress.

This purpose is even clearer now than it was in 1879.
Today Chevron touches the lives of billions of people across the globe delivering affordable reliable ever-cleaner energy that offers access to the necessities of modern life drives economic and social development and creates the promise for a better future.

We feel proud and privileged to fulfill this responsibility to invest in the communities where we operate and to generate sustained value for our stockholders customers and employees.

Our strong performance in 2018 enabled us to deliver on all of our financial priorities – growing the dividend funding a disciplined capital program strengthening the balance sheet and returning surplus cash to stockholders.

financial highlights from 2018 include:
net income
14.8 billion

up 5.6 billion from 2017

capital employed
8.2% return

up from 5% in 2017

sales and other operating revenues
158.9 billion

up 24.2 billion from 2017

record free cash flow
16.8 billion

the highest level ever achieved by Chevron in any price environment

For the 31st consecutive year Chevron increased the annual per-share dividend payout. We returned an additional 1.75 billion of cash to stockholders through stock repurchases. In addition we further strengthened the balance sheet reducing our debt ratio to 18 percent.

This performance reflects momentum across all our operating segments.

Our Upstream business reported a highest-ever worldwide net production of more than 2.9 million oil-equivalent barrels per day up more than 7 percent from 2017 and 12 percent from 2016. Production increases were driven by Permian Basin growth startups in the Gulf of Mexico and Australia continued ramp-up of liquified natural gas (LNG) operations in Australia and a high level of reliability at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan.

We added approximately 1.46 billion barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves replacing 136 percent of production. Our five-year reserve replacement ratio is 117 percent.

Chevron increased development drilling in the Permian Basin and we expect continued strong production growth in the Permian over the next several years. We also acquired new exploration acreage including six blocks in Brazil and 31 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. Construction continued on the Future Growth Project and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Kazakhstan including first module delivery and installation.

Chevron is among the Largest Producers of Oil and Natural Gas in the Permian Basin
Permian Basin: Chevron and its legacy companies have been a ?xture in the Permian Basin which is located in the southwestern United States since the early 1920s. In 2011 Chevron produced its 5 billionth barrel from the Permian. Today we are among the largest producers of oil and natural gas in the basin and with approximately 2.2 million net acres (8903 sq km) Chevron is one of the Permian Basin’s largest net acreage holders.

In Downstream & Chemicals we commissioned a new hydrogen plant as part of the Richmond Refinery Modernization Project. In our Oronite additives business we broke ground on our blending and shipping project in Ningbo China. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company commissioned its world-scale ethane cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility as part of the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. We also expanded our new retail marketing network in Mexico with 135 stations opened as of year-end 2018.

Our Midstream business delivered the first LNG cargo from the Gorgon project to the new LNG receiving terminal in Zhoushan China an important achievement that will help China meet its goal of increasing natural gas in its overall energy mix. In the Permian Basin Chevron strategically secured pipeline capacity to maximize value in advance of our production ramp-up. Our Shipping organization supported the safe and successful delivery of the first modular component to the Future Growth Project in Kazakhstan – a voyage of nearly 17000 miles.

Chevron delivered these results in a year characterized by healthy global economic activity and heightened geopolitical tensions. Global liquids demand surpassed 100 million barrels a day for the first time ever. Commodity prices rose during the first nine months of 2018 driven by strong demand before declining in the last quarter. LNG markets continued to respond to strength in Asian gas demand. The return of U.S. sanctions on Iran volatility in the Middle East trade tensions between China and the United States Russia sanctions and worsening conditions in Venezuela created further uncertainty for global energy markets.

Although market conditions may remain volatile our portfolio is resilient. We are focused on creating value through a disciplined capital program that prioritizes efficient low-risk short-cycle investments. Our Upstream portfolio is anchored by large long-lived assets with low production decline. An efficient high-return Downstream business complements our Upstream. Across all our business segments we are accelerating the deployment of digital technologies to improve revenues reduce costs increase reliability and improve safety. We are making smart investments and building our company to win in any environment.

In 2018 we also had our best year ever in health environment and safety performance with no fatalities of employees or contractors in any of our operations. We continue to lead the industry in personal safety performance and meet or exceed targets on all core personal safety metrics. This performance is directly related to our strong Operational Excellence culture and an increased focus on safeguard assurance for high-risk work.


record safety

2018 marks our best year on record in health environment and safety

In every instance Chevron’s performance rests on the strong foundation created by our people and our culture. The environment in which we operate is dynamic. The biggest questions of the future remain unanswered. Our work is complex and demanding. Yet for 140 years the ingenuity of our people has led to new insights new discoveries and new innovations.

This is not a coincidence. Our culture is defined by our values which emphasize a deep commitment to diversity and inclusion high performance innovation integrity and trust. This has been part of our DNA for decades.

To hold ourselves to this high standard – and to ensure an effective approach to human capital management – we regularly seek employee feedback to understand where Chevron is performing well and where we can further improve. Our Board of Directors takes this input seriously – and we act on it. Based on feedback we are working to Build Our Tomorrow by putting new digital technologies in the hands of employees promoting better faster decision making and revamping our performance management system.

We use social media and other platforms to create access to information remove organizational barriers and bridge vast geographic expanses to exchange ideas and communicate. These are just some of the ways we put The Chevron Way to work ensuring a culture in which all voices are heard all ideas are considered and all our people have the opportunity to contribute to their fullest.

Actions like these are essential in today’s environment. But we recognize that leadership goes well beyond delivering strong financial returns and creating a compelling work experience. We must also deliver value for society.

We provide the affordable reliable ever-cleaner energy needed to meet rising demand. By 2040 the global population is expected to reach roughly 9 billion people and the International Energy Agency expects global energy demand to increase by nearly 30 percent. Our strengths across Upstream Midstream and Downstream position us to help meet society’s growing need for energy.

We will meet this demand in a way that respects society’s concerns about climate change and aspirations for a cleaner environment – views we share. This requires innovation. In 2018 we launched the 100 million Future Energy Fund a venture capital fund established to invest in breakthrough technologies. Early investments include an electric vehicle charging network novel battery technology and direct capture of carbon dioxide from the air.

We also joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) a coalition of 13 global companies cooperating on constructive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Our commitment includes a 100 million contribution to OGCI’s more than 1 billion fund to invest in technologies and businesses that promise meaningful greenhouse gas emissions reductions.

During my first year as chairman and CEO I visited our operations around the world to listen to and learn from our employees. In my travels I was often asked: “Why do you work for Chevron?” We work for our families. We work for our communities. We work to make the world a better place. And we work because we are proud of what we do.

Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth Visiting Chevron Operations Listening and Learning from Employees
I am honored to serve the women and men of Chevron. I am humbled by the opportunity to help build on our company’s 140-year history and the work of generations of talented problem solvers who have turned some of the greatest challenges of our time into vast human opportunities for advancement. I am proud too to represent a fundamental truth: energy enables human progress. I am committed to this truth and I am fully confident that our people will continue to lead in the decades to come.

Sincerely

our traditional automotive business. At the same time we accelerated
our efforts to be a leader in the mobility services of tomorrow.
As we reinvent our business for the future we remain committed to
achieving strong results in the present. While 2018 was challenging
we still achieved our ninth consecutive year of solid earnings and
positive operating-related cash flow. These profits enabled us to
distribute 3.1 billion to our shareholders last year for a total of
18.4 billion since 2012.
Looking ahead to improve returns in the nearer term we are reducing
costs improving operating efficiencies and focusing our resources on
vehicles that better meet our customers’ needs. This includes shifting
90 percent of our North American vehicle lineup volume to sport
utility vehicles crossovers trucks and commercial vehicles between
2018 and the end of 2020. We plan to refresh 75 percent of our lineup
in the United States by the end of 2020 including the introduction of
all-new Ford Ranger Escape and Explorer vehicles this year.
As we strengthen our product portfolio we are committed to reducing
vehicle emissions by delivering CO2
 reductions consistent with the
Paris Accord. We are investing 11 billion in electrification and plan
to electrify our most popular nameplates including an all-electric
Mustang-inspired performance utility and Ford F-150.
Looking farther into the future the actions we are taking to improve
efficiencies are freeing up capital to invest in emerging businesses. We
expect to invest 4 billion in our autonomous vehicle efforts through
2023 including our 1 billion investment in Argo AI.
To help us achieve our vision for the future of transportation in 2018
we acquired the iconic Michigan Central Station in Detroit’s historic
Corktown neighborhood. We plan to transform this former railroad
station into the centerpiece of a vibrant new campus where Ford and
its partners will work on autonomous and electric vehicle businesses
and design solutions for a transportation operating system that
makes mobility convenient and accessible. More than just a collection
of buildings Corktown will serve as a magnet for talent and a catalyst
for change.
The future we are building at our new mobility campus is rooted in our
past. More than 115 years ago we began building cars in a small factory
in Detroit. From those humble beginnings we went on to revolutionize
mass production build the first affordable car and put the world on
wheels. Our mission then was to make people’s lives better by making
mobility accessible and affordable.
That remains our mission today.
As we move through the 21st century we are reimagining what mobility
will look like beyond the privately owned internal combustion engine
automobile. That means not just smart cars but also smart roads
smart parking smart public transit systems and ways for them all
to talk to one another. It means rethinking cities so that even as
millions more people call them home the air is cleaner the streets
less congested and everyone has access to efficient affordable and
sustainable mobility.
To make this vision a reality we are working with and investing in all kinds
of new businesses from radar and mapping technologies to artificial
intelligence platforms. We have a strategic alliance with Mahindra in India
that includes powertrain sharing and connected vehicle solutions.
More recently we announced an alliance with Volkswagen that will
begin with developing midsize pickup trucks for global markets
starting by 2022 followed by commercial vans. This alliance will drive
scale and efficiencies and enable us to share investments in vehicle
architectures that deliver distinct capabilities and technologies.
The greatest competitive advantage we have going forward is the
trust we have earned by providing mobility to people around the world
for more than a century.
Since the days of the Model T people have trusted us to get them where
they want to go do what is right for them and make their lives better.
Whatever form mobility takes in the future our board of directors
leadership team and extended family of employees are determined to
continue earning that trust as we strive to become the world’s most
trusted company designing smart vehicles for a smart world.
Thank you for your support of our efforts.

emissions and zero congestion. Today’s technologies give us a
unique opportunity to make personal mobility better safer and
more sustainable. Each year more than one million people are
killed in crashes around the world – 40000 in the U.S. alone. When
you consider that human error is behind more than 90% of these
crashes we believe autonomous vehicles (“AVs”) will save lives.
We are fully committed to an all-electric future and we are already
building on the momentum of the groundbreaking Chevrolet Bolt
EV. In January we announced that our Cadillac brand will lead the
way on our next-generation electric vehicle (“EV”) technology. At
the same time we are improving the efficiency of today’s vehicles
with lightweighting and sophisticated new transmissions and
engines. To redefine the future of transportation we must execute
with speed and discipline and I am confident we have the team
and the technology to lead.
How do you think about culture at GM?
MARY: Our culture will determine the long-term success of the
Company. I’ve heard from many employees who feel that they are
part of something bigger and who are excited about making a
positive impact on the world.
We have been on a cultural journey since 2014 when the ignition
switch recall threatened our recovery from bankruptcy. At our
senior leadership team meeting that year we realized that to
transform our culture we needed to address the underlying issues
that were holding us back. So as a team we aligned ourselves
around a shared set of behaviors built on our core values that
continue to guide our actions today. Since that time we have
introduced various initiatives to create a workplace and culture in
which our team members can thrive yet be accountable for their
performance.
TIM: Your Board of Directors (the “Board”) believes that culture is
key to realizing GM’s vision of zero crashes zero emissions and
zero congestion. By sharing our outside perspectives your Board
has helped GM reshape its behaviors and ultimately its culture as
it continues its transformation.
In November 2018 GM announced a comprehensive plan to
accelerate its strategic transformation. Can you discuss why you
took these actions?
TIM: We have been navigating the dramatic changes facing our
industry and taking decisive actions to stay in front of this change.
Over the years we have strengthened our core business by
deploying resources in regions and franchises where we see higherreturn opportunities over the long term.
MARY: Our focus all along has been to reposition the Company
from one of trying to be all things to all people in all markets to one
that is strategic agile and profitable. By accelerating GM’s
transformation we can more rapidly invest in the future of
personal mobility. Our transformation plan involves tough but
necessary actions. We took these actions following significant
feedback and input from the Board – input that began during our
annual strategic review in 2017 and continued throughout 2018.
This is a dynamic transformation process and we will continue to
look around corners and over the horizon to make strategic
decisions that strengthen our business today and position it for
long-term success.
What is GM doing to create a more sustainable future?
TIM: Your Board understands that for GM to remain a compelling
investment opportunity the Company must contribute to a safer
more sustainable future particularly through continued efforts to
reduce emissions from vehicles and facilities. GM is committed to
an all-electric future as well as maintaining a sustainable supply
chain. For example in 2018 GM sourced 20% of its total power
from renewable sources – leading the automotive sector and
progressing towards our commitment to source 100% of our power
from renewable sources by 2050.
MARY: We believe in the science of climate change and we
recognize that the transportation sector is a contributor to global
greenhouse gas emissions. We have called on lawmakers to
establish a National Zero Emission Vehicle program – a
comprehensive approach to drive the scale and infrastructure
investments needed to enable the U.S. to lead the way to a
zero-emissions future – as well as enact complementary policies to
spur market acceptance and commercialization of EVs"
14,Costco Wholesale,141576,15,129025,182000,W. Craig Jelinek,President Chief Executive Officer &  Director,Retailing,General Merchandisers,24,Issaquah,WA,47.5301011,-122.0326191,"Dear Costco Shareholders:
When Costco was founded 35 years ago we did not envision that we would become a 138 billion retailer
employ over 245000 people operate over 750 warehouses or serve more than 94 million members
worldwide. Nor did we envision the breadth of products and services we now offer; or that what began as
a “cash-and-carry” operation would extend to delivering products to our members’ doorsteps. What we did
know and set out to do was maintain a steadfast commitment to value and integrity. We honor this
commitment in all aspects of our business from providing quality merchandise at terrific prices; to treating
members employees and vendors with courtesy and respect; and to working closely with suppliers to
promote fairness dignity and safety throughout our supply chains.
These commitments and our unwavering “do the right thing” philosophy led us to another strong year in
fiscal 2018. Net sales for the 52-week fiscal year totaled 138 billion an increase of 9.7 percent with a
comparable sales increase of 9 percent. Net income for the 52-week fiscal year was 3.134 billion or 7.09
per share an increase of 17 percent. Revenue from membership fees increased 10.1 percent to 3.142
billion.
In addition to investing 3 billion in capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 to expand our business in many
ways strong cash flows in fiscal 2018 allowed us to also declare dividends of 939 million and repurchase
shares of 322 million. As well income tax savings from the recent U.S. tax law changes provided funding
to raise wages for most of our U.S. employees.
Costco remains strong and competitive in today's dynamic retail climate. We continue to open warehouses
domestically and internationally expand and improve our ecommerce business and add products under
our Kirkland Signature™ brand. The Kirkland Signature™ brand has become globally recognized as a “gold
standard” of high quality and exceptional value. In 2018 Kirkland Signature sales exceeded 39 billion
compared to 35 billion in the prior year. We have broadened our selection in apparel organic and fresh
foods household basics sporting goods and health and beauty products including the introduction of a
new razor. We have also intensified our focus on in-country sourcing driving costs down enhancing member
value and reducing the environmental impacts of transportation.
With respect to vertical integration we continue to explore opportunities that will allow us to realize even
greater member satisfaction whether driven by price quality or a combination. We enjoy continued success
in our bakery commissary in Canada various packaging operations optical and pharmacy central-fill
locations and U.S. meat plants. Our chicken complex in Nebraska which is currently under construction
should yield similar results.
In 2018 we reached a milestone with our 750WK warehouse location. Fiscal . 2018 expansion included the
opening of 21 new warehouses around the globe with our 100th location in Canada; and we continue to
add gas stations and other ancillary services to locations in different countries. We are not only focused on
new markets but how we strategically infill and relocate within markets where we currently operate. In
2019 we expect to open 23 new warehouses and relocate up to 4 warehouses to more ideal locations.
Especially anticipated is the planned opening in 2019 of our West Shanghai warehouse our first in China.
Our capital plans also extend to making improvements in our logistics that will drive value for our members.
We are investing in new ecommerce fulfillment centers and improved transportation logistics.
Membership renewal rates in the U.S. and Canada were 90 percent and renewal rates worldwide saw an
increase to 88 percent. We are seeing higher sign-up rates from younger generations and a more diverse
membership base. This shift can be partially attributed to our buyers’ increased focus on products that have
an appeal that spans generations as well as sourcing products globally to expand cultural and ethnic
offerings.
Strong comparable sales and shopping frequency during fiscal 2018 reaffirm the demand and desire by
our members to shop in our warehouses. In 2018 we tested technology that will allow merchandise to be
moved faster through the registers and deployed self-checkout registers as well as self-ordering kiosks for
the Food Court. Research and development is underway toward a fob that will allow members to pay for
gas with a single swipe eliminating the need to access their membership or credit cards.
We remain keenly aware that changing preferences of consumers technological advancements and the
ever-changing retail climate will continue to alter the ways in which members shop. “Hot buys” ecommerce
product showcases online ordering capabilities and grocery delivery have all contributed to sales growth
of over 30% in ecommerce for the fiscal year. Along with everyday merchandise impressive sales were
achieved in high-end items at outstanding values such as Super Bowl tickets packages diamonds tablets
and laptops designer handbags and accessories and once-in-a-lifetime vacation packages. Our new “hotel
only” booking engine and expanded partnerships with new hotels provide greater value and convenience
for our members. Such activities have positively impacted our business both online and in-warehouse
and are helping our sales momentum while also increasing our digital presence.
We remain committed to operating our business and sourcing our products using sustainable practices
being mindful of our global impact on people communities and the environment. We believe sustainability
is important to many of us who care deeply about how and where a product originates the treatment of
workers and animals and environmental impacts. We strive to be good stewards and follow our code of
conduct requiring sustainable practices from suppliers manufacturers and farmers. This includes
eliminating harmful chemicals emphasizing recycled and compostable packaging materials saving energy
at our warehouses and depots and donating more perishable items to food banks.
We continue to be proud of creating a climate of inclusion diversity and a positive work environment for
employees globally. We recognize our consistently efficient and loyal employee base with competitive pay
and benefits and opportunities for growth and advancement. These sentiments were recently acknowledged
in a survey by Indeed identifying Costco as one of the top five Best Rated Workplaces in 2018 among
Fortune 500 companies. Our relationship with our employees is fundamental to driving our business not
only in the present but over the long term.
We reached a key milestone as Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal stepped down in 2018 ending 35 years
with the Company. Jim’s extraordinary vision passion and work ethic have impacted so many. While Jim
still is frequently seen at the corporate headquarters and regularly visits warehouses he is enjoying more
time with family and actively participating in philanthropic and other pursuits. We remain resolute in carrying
on the principal philosophy and values that Jim along with Jeff Brotman originally established for Costco
in 1983.
In closing I express my gratitude to the 245000 employees and more than 94 million members worldwide
who help make Costco the undeniable leader in membership warehouses and one of the best retailers
worldwide.
Thank you for your continued trust in and support of Costco. May the year ahead bring you and your families
good health happiness peace and prosperity.

I’ve been on the Google then Alphabet Board for 15 years. I’ve had the privilege to work closely with Sergey Larry Sundar and
an evolving and diverse group of directors. And last year I had the honor of becoming Alphabet’s Chairman.
The companies that comprise Alphabet continue to build technologies that improve the lives of people everywhere. Google now
has eight products serving over a billion people each a reflection of the truly global adoption of its products and services and
a tribute to a lot of hard work and commitment from our employees. It’s also partnering deeply to help enterprises transition to
cloud computing. Already on the road in Phoenix Arizona Waymo is working to ensure that people can safely hail rides from selfdriving cars. Wing has just received FAA approval to start delivering goods by drone. And we are making progress on a number
of other important areas from health to artiƒcial intelligence.
1f course as the beneƒts of technology spread to many more people we know that we have a deep and growing responsibility
to ensure that technology beneƒts society as a whole. We’re committed to supporting our users employees and shareholders
by always acting responsibly inclusively and fairly.
Our Board takes seriously its leadership and oversight role in these areas. Recent years have seen broader discussions around
the role of companies in promoting diversity and sustainability. These are issues we are deeply committed to as a Board and as
a company.
Our Board receives frequent updates from management monitors progress scrutinizes the company’s policies and carefully
considers these complex issues with the attention and focus that they warrant. In recent years we’ve tackled these issues in
important and meaningful ways. Just a few examples:
y Employee Policies and Workplace Culture - In the last year Google has made signiƒcant changes to its policies and practices
including improved information on how it handles workplace conduct concerns; providing employees with more control over
their experiences through the reporting and investigations process; no longer requiring arbitration for employment disputes;
signiƒcant work to improve diversity equity and inclusion; and increasing transparency about its progress in achieving better
outcomes in representation hiring retention and compensation.
y Sustainability - Our sustainability program focuses on developing services that improve the lives of as many people as possible
while operating in an environmentally sustainable way. Google is a world leader in renewable energy investment and use. In
addition we publish an annual Responsible Supply Chain Report and Environmental Report that chart the signiƒcant progress
we have made in this area.
y Ongoing Monitoring of Societal Impact - In 2018 Google made substantial investments to improve and measure the quality
of content across its properties to combat the threat of electoral interference and other bad actors and to expand programs
such as Grow with Google— an initiative to help people develop the digital skills they need to get a job or grow their business.
Google is committed to a rigorous process of responsible decision-making and has developed AI Principles to guide its work
in emerging areas of technology.
These important topics will continue to evolve and so will our approaches to them. I can promise that we will always move
forward with the focus and attention that these challenges demand.
On behalf of the Board of Directors we look forward to working with you and serving you in the years to come. Thank you for
your support and feedback and I look forward to seeing you at the Stockholders meeting on June 19th.

As investors in Cardinal Health you put your trust in us to be
responsible stewards of your capital. I want to begin my first letter
as chief executive officer by sharing with you how we’re doing
and where we’re going.
Over the past several years we set and achieved a
number of important strategic goals. Three of the most
significant were:
• We grew our specialty business from a 1 billion
mostly blood products business to a 15 billion
business offering diversified services to both
manufacturers and providers;
• We partnered with CVS Health to build a best-in-class
large-scale generics program through a successful
50/50 joint venture; and
• We significantly expanded our medical products
portfolio through organic expansion and the
acquisitions of the Cordis and the Patient
Recovery businesses to complement our
medical distribution capabilities.
We are encouraged by the strategic progress we’ve
made and are committed to making further strides in
the coming year. We are moving aggressively to address
challenges that affect our markets and our business by
taking decisive action to drive growth reduce costs
and improve the profitability of our company. Work we
began in fiscal 2018 combined with a series of initiatives
we have begun implementing in fiscal 2019 are setting
us on the right track to deliver long-term growth and
enhance value for all of our stakeholders.
Fiscal 2018 performance
On a financial basis for fiscal year 2018 revenue reached
137 billion up more than 5%. GAAP operating earnings
were 126 million compared to 2.1 billion last year and
non-GAAP operating earnings were 2.6 billion compared
to 2.8 billion last year. GAAP operating earnings included
a Medical segment non-cash goodwill impairment of
1.4 billion primarily due to the performance of the
Cordis business. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS)
attributable to Cardinal Health were 0.81 compared to
4.03 last year and non-GAAP EPS were 5.00 down 7%
from last year. Net cash generated by operating activities
for fiscal 2018 was a solid 2.8 billion.
Pharmaceutical segment profit declined for the year
by 9%. On a positive note the Nuclear and Specialty
Solutions businesses continued to grow with Specialty
being a standout. Our challenge was in our core
Pharmaceutical Distribution business where generic
programs and customer contract renewals were
headwinds. To address these challenges our team is
actively evaluating multiple upstream and downstream
opportunities and we continue to assess our contracting
models in light of shifts in the environment.
The Medical segment’s profit increased 16% year
over year. Many of the Medical businesses including
Cardinal Health at Home the Global Services
division and our recently acquired Patient Recovery
business delivered strong performances. However
Cardinal Health branded products primarily Cordis
encountered cost and inventory challenges.
As we exited the fiscal year we reinforced our
commitment to a future of growth. To that end
we are in the midst of a comprehensive top-down
bottom-up review of our business and have identified
six priority areas to drive long-term growth and
shareholder returns. These initiatives form our
roadmap for the next few years.
3
Fiscal 2019 priorities
We see exciting opportunities for Cardinal Health as
well as significant work to be done to best position
the company in an evolving industry landscape to
deliver the greatest value for our investors customers
communities and employees. Specifically we are
focused on the following in fiscal 2019:
1.We are actively evaluating our portfolio and
business mix.
This is an ongoing effort that we intensified in
fiscal 2018 with a number of actions to simplify our
business and focus resources on the right growth
opportunities. We are taking a disciplined approach
to evaluating the best use of our capital to generate
long-term returns.
Following our analysis of the market in China we
made the decision to exit our distribution business
there. It was clear that the returns we were seeing and
the prospects for market leadership did not justify
maintaining our current position or committing the
additional level of investment required for future
growth. Consequently we completed the sale of this
business on February 1 2018.
Using this same disciplined approach we entered into
a partnership with Clayton Dubilier & Rice effective
August 1 2018 to accelerate the growth of the
naviHealth business. Our team worked to structure
a partnership to unlock value and give naviHealth
even more resources to support its growth trajectory.
Cardinal Health retains approximately a 45% interest
in the business which allows us to continue to benefit
from the growth we believe naviHealth can achieve.
2.We are evaluating upstream and downstream
elements of our pharmaceutical model.
Pharmaceutical Distribution continues to face industry
headwinds related to changing pricing dynamics. As
such we are actively evaluating our cost structure
accelerating growth initiatives looking at customer
contracting models and discussing evolving fee
structures with branded manufacturers. While we
expect the headwinds to persist in the coming year we
have been through similar challenges before and are
taking action to return the Pharmaceutical Distribution
business to its more typical upward trajectory.
3.We are stabilizing the Cordis business and
positioning it for growth.
I have great confidence in the new management
team who are taking critical steps to address Cordis’
business challenges. With improved data we are
making substantial progress in addressing inventory
levels demand planning product portfolio and
cost structure challenges. We are encouraged by the
progress of this business and continue to believe in its
significant long-term growth potential.
4.We are integrating the Patient Recovery business.
Following the completion of our acquisition of the
Patient Recovery business at the beginning of fiscal
2018 our team began working diligently to assure
a smooth and seamless integration of this business.
This integration is on schedule and in the coming
year we will continue to focus on successfully exiting
our Transition Service Agreements and delivering
product penetration in all key markets. We are
pleased that this business met our fiscal 2018 goal of
being accretive to non-GAAP EPS by more than 0.21.
In their commitment to integrating this business and
executing against their goals this global team has
demonstrated grit speed and teamwork in action.
5.We are laser focused on our cost structure.
We are committed to approaching our cost structure
and operations diligently and responsibly. This
includes creating a culture in which every manager
is asking what we should do versus what we could
do and what we should spend versus what we could
spend. Using various tools and analytics we plan to
deliver more than 200 million in annualized savings
by fiscal 2020. Simply put we are intensely focused on
each dollar we spend.

Our Generation Rx program was created nearly
a decade ago in conjunction with The Ohio State
University School of Pharmacy to address medication
safety and prescription drug abuse prevention
education. Building on this strong foundation in
fiscal 2018 we launched our Opioid Action Program
which is focused on addressing the over-prescribing
of opioid pain medications by medical practitioners
and providing support to first responders dealing with
overdoses; assisting with drug take-back days around
the country; and increasing funding for community
efforts around education and advocacy. Along with
other leaders in healthcare we are committed to
addressing the devastating consequences that the overprescribing of opioid medications and the addiction and
abuse of those medications and illegal street narcotics
have had on our families and communities.
A corporate culture that
drives success
I love our culture. For 28 years I’ve been proud to work
alongside the people of Cardinal Health — employees
who are dedicated hard-working and focused on our
customers and the needs of their patients. We roll up
our sleeves to get the job done. We know how to pull
together in good times and bad. All of us take pride in
our role in healthcare. We know that to do our jobs well
we need a high-performing accountable culture. We
also know that to be successful we have to recruit and
retain the best and most diverse team.
The idea that people of all genders ethnicities and
backgrounds can thrive and succeed so we can benefit
from their perspectives is very important to me personally.
This has been part of the Cardinal Health ethos for
years and our Diversity & Inclusion Council continues to
prioritize this work and pursue actionable goals. I want all
employees to be able to bring their whole selves to work
every day. Inclusion is imperative to our success and our
ability to compete globally. I take it very seriously and I
expect every employee to do the same.
Our culture is also shaped by our leaders and since
January it has been my honor to succeed George
Barrett who passionately led the company as our
CEO for nine years. I want to thank George for his
6.We are taking a judicious disciplined approach
to capital deployment.
We believe that taking a disciplined approach to capital
deployment includes reinvestments in the business
for future growth as well as returning cash to you our
shareholders. In fiscal 2018 we paid out 580 million
in dividends and repurchased 550 million in shares.
Just recently in the month of August we entered into
an accelerated share repurchase program to acquire
shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase
price of 600 million. In addition any M&A transactions
that we might consider in the near term would be
limited and focused. Overall our approach will be
judicious and thoughtful.
In summary we are prioritizing what is important
devoting resources to what will drive our business
forward while minimizing distractions. Our approach to
costs and spending is disciplined and growth-oriented.
And importantly we are focused on flawless execution.
I am proud of what our team is achieving and the goals
in place for the year ahead.
A leader in healthcare and
in our communities
Cardinal Health plays a critical role in the delivery of
healthcare and our customers rely on us for high quality
products and efficient operations. Through our services
and products we serve nearly 85% of hospitals more
than 26000 pharmacies and more than 10000 specialty
physician offices and clinics across the U.S. In fiscal 2018
our nearly 50000 global employees operated in more
than 46 countries.
As a healthcare leader we feel a deep responsibility to
be a positive force for good in our communities and we
want to do even more to improve the health and wellbeing of our neighbors where we live and work. For
many years our community relations efforts have been
meaningful and wide-ranging. These include a best-inclass program promoting patient safety in dozens of
hospitals; grants to organizations that promote research
and wellness programs to combat global diseases; and
emotional physical and financial support for veterans
and their families.

appreciate his support and guidance.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank three of
our esteemed directors Dave Anderson Clay Jones and
Dave King who will be leaving our board of directors.
They each have been valuable members of the board
and their contributions will be missed. We have an active
search underway for new directors to complement the
expertise and experience of our existing board members.
As we enter a new fiscal year we are squarely focused
on driving the greatest value from an attractive portfolio
of assets. Everything is on the table when it comes to
delivering long-term growth enhancing shareholder
returns and serving our customers and their patients. At
every level of Cardinal Health we are committed to being
disciplined in our approach and to achieving substantial
results in the months and years ahead.
We appreciate your investment in Cardinal Health and
you have my commitment that we will work hard every
day to earn the trust you have placed in us.
Sincerely

I am pleased to present the Walgreens Boots Alliance Proxy Statement
with details of our steadfast and ongoing commitment to sound corporate
governance. My fellow directors and I are dedicated to strong
independent Board leadership and to evolving our governance practices
with the benefit of open dialogue with stockholders. This engagement
and an understanding of stockholder priorities is critical to our success.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the stockholders who met
with us over the past year and provided invaluable input to our corporate
governance practices. We are grateful for the opportunity to continue
these important conversations. William C. Foote
As in prior years we continue to conduct a robust multi-step Board evaluation process which we believe
is an essential component of Board effectiveness. We also regularly discuss director succession and
board refreshment both in executive sessions and as a full Board.
Our Company’s performance was strong in fiscal 2018 with growth in many financial and operating
metrics including earnings operating income cash flow U.S. prescriptions filled and U.S. retail
prescription market share. Our businesses delivered continued progress while operating in the highly
competitive healthcare and retail industries which have experienced significant consolidation.
We maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation during 2018; investing opportunistically to
expand our offering and our footprint drive growth and develop our human capital. We continued to
demonstrate our commitment to return excess cash to our stockholders over the long term through the
43rd consecutive annual increase in our dividend (including by our predecessor company Walgreen Co.)
as well as the authorization in June 2018 of a 10 billion share repurchase program.
We are pleased to have completed the acquisition of all 1932 Rite Aid stores that we agreed to purchase
from Rite Aid Corporation under an amended and restated asset purchase agreement. The transaction
including the transition of three distribution centers and related inventory that began during fiscal 2019
furthers our Company’s commitment to accessible affordable quality healthcare in the U.S. and to
advance consumer access to pharmacy-led health and wellbeing.
Our Company touches millions of lives around the world every day through the medicines we dispense
and distribute our convenient retail stores and our health and beauty products. Thus we believe we are
uniquely situated to help people communities and the planet. The Board’s Nominating and Governance
Committee which I chair and which is made up entirely of independent directors continued to review and
monitor our Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies and activities.
The Board through the Committee shares in our Company’s commitment to responsible leadership
sustainable business practices and transparency. Our Company has impacted millions of lives through our
healthcare-centered CSR initiatives helping to provide lifesaving immunizations life-changing vitamins
health screening and HIV testing; educating our pharmacists to assist patients with the emotional as well
as the physical aspects of cancer; supporting cancer research; providing access to healthcare services
and continuity of care following natural disasters; and raising awareness around dementia and mental
health. Consistent with input received from our stockholders we took action to support our Company’s
efforts to help combat the U.S. opioid abuse crisis through the expansion of a safe medication takeback
program and other initiatives.

Dear Fellow Shareholders
Once again I begin this annual letter to shareholders with a sense of pride about
our company and our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world. As I
look back on the last decade — a period of profound political and economic change
— it is remarkable how much we have accomplished not only in terms of financial
performance but in our steadfast dedication to help clients communities and
countries all around the world.
In 2018 we continued to accelerate investments in products services and
technology. For example for the first time in nearly a decade we extended our
presence in several states with new Chase branches (we plan to open another 400
new branches in the next few years). In addition we started a new digital investing
platform: You Invest; we launched our partnership with Amazon and Berkshire
Hathaway in healthcare; we broadened our commitment to create opportunities
for jobs and prosperity and reduce the wealth gap for black Americans with
Advancing Black Pathways (announced in February 2019); and we launched our

AdvancingCities initiative to support job and wage growth in communities most
in need of capital. While it is too soon to assess the impact of these efforts we’re
seeing terrific results so far.
2018 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase with the firm generating record
revenue and net income even without the impact of tax reform. We earned
32.5 billion in net income on revenue1
 of 111.5 billion reflecting strong underlying
performance across our businesses. Adjusting for the enactment of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act we now have delivered record results in eight of the last nine years
and we have confidence that we will continue to deliver in the future. Each line
of business grew revenue and net income for the year while continuing to make
significant investments in products people and technology. We grew core loans
by 7% increased deposits in total by 3% and generally grew market share across
our businesses all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance
sheet. In total we extended credit and raised capital of 2.5 trillion for businesses
institutional clients and U.S. customers.
In last year’s letter we emphasized how important a competitive global tax system
is for America. Over the last 20 years as the world reduced its tax rates America
did not. Our previous tax code was increasingly uncompetitive overly complex and
loaded with special interest provisions that created winners and losers. This drove
down capital investment in the United States which reduced domestic productivity
and wage growth. The new tax code establishes a business tax rate that will
make the United States competitive around the world and frees U.S. companies
to bring back profits earned overseas. The cumulative effect of capital retained
and reinvested over many years in the United States will help cultivate strong
businesses and ultimately create jobs and increase wages.
For JPMorgan Chase all things being equal (which they are not) the new lower
tax rates added 3.7 billion to net income. For the long term we expect that
some or eventually most of that increase will be erased as companies compete
for customers on products capabilities and prices. However we did take this
opportunity in the short term to massively increase our investments in technology
new branches and bankers salaries (we now pay a minimum of 31000 a year
for full time entry-level jobs in the United States) philanthropy and lending
(specifically in lower income neighborhoods).

As you know we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the
value we have created for our shareholders. If our asset and liability values are
appropriate — and we believe they are — and if we can continue to deploy this
capital profitably we think we can continue to exceed 15% return on tangible
equity for the next several years (and potentially at or above 17% in the near term)
assuming there is not a significant downturn. If we can earn these types of returns
our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book
value. The chart on the bottom of the opposite page shows that tangible book value
“anchors” the stock price.
In the last five years we have bought back almost 55 billion in stock or
approximately 660 million shares which is nearly 20% of the company’s common
shares outstanding. In prior letters I explained why buying back our stock at
tangible book value per share was a no-brainer. Seven years ago we offered an
example of this: If we bought back a large block of stock at tangible book value
earnings and tangible book value per share would be substantially higher just four
years later than without the buyback. While we prefer buying back our stock at
tangible book value we think it makes sense to do so even at or above two times
tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the past. If we
buy back a big block of stock this year we would expect (using analysts’ earnings

estimates) earnings per share in five years to be 2%–3% higher and tangible book
value to be virtually unchanged. We want to remind our shareholders that we much
prefer to use our capital to grow than to buy back stock. I discuss stock buybacks
later in this letter.
While we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run in
the long run our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the
years. This progress is a function of continual investments in good and bad times
to build our capabilities — our people systems and products. These important
investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow
and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five years 10 years or since
the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger (approximately 14 years ago) our stock
has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard
& Poor’s Financials Index. And this growth came during a time of unprecedented
challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and the extraordinarily difficult
legal regulatory and political environment that followed.

JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions pension plans mutual funds
and directly by individual investors. However it is important to remember that
in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities.
Well over 100 million people in the United States own stock and a large
percentage of these individuals in one way or another own JPMorgan Chase
stock. Many of these people are veterans teachers police officers firefighters
retirees or those saving for a home school or retirement. Your management
team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we
have to perform for our shareholders.
In the first section of this letter I try to give a comprehensive understanding of
how we run our company including how we think about building shareholder
value for the long run. In that section I highlight our strong belief that building
shareholder value can only be done in conjunction with taking care of employees
customers and communities. This is completely different from the commentary
often expressed about the sweeping ills of naked capitalism and institutions only
caring about shareholder value.
In the second section of this letter I comment on important forward-looking issues.
While we remain optimistic about the long-term growth of the United States and
the world the near-term economic and political backdrop is increasingly complex
and fraught with risks — both known and unknown. And we face a future with less
overall confidence in virtually all institutions from corporations to governments
to the media. The extremely volatile global markets in the fourth quarter of 2018
might be a harbinger of things to come — creating both risks for our company and
opportunities to serve our clients.
The third section of this letter is about public policy specifically American public
policy which is a major concern for our country and therefore our company.
Again I try to give a comprehensive multi-year overview of what I see as some of
our problems and suggest a few ways they can be addressed. One consistent theme
is completely clear: Businesses governments and communities need to work as
partners collaboratively and constructively to analyze and solve problems and
help strengthen the economy for everyone’s benefit.
I. JPMorgan Chase Principles and Strategies
1. First and foremost we look at our business from the point of view of the
customer.
2. We endeavor to be the best at anything and everything we do.
3. We will maintain a fortress balance sheet — and fortress financial principles.
4. We lift up our communities.
5. We take care of our employees.
6. We always strive to learn more about management and leadership.
7. We do not worry about some issues.
II. Comments on Current Critical Issues
1. We need to continue to restore trust in the strength of the U.S. banking system
and global systemically important financial institutions.
2. We have to remind ourselves that responsible banking is good and safe banking.
3. We believe in good regulation — both to help America grow and improve
financial stability.
4. We believe stock buybacks are an essential part of proper capital allocation
but secondary to long-term investing.
5. On the importance of the cloud and artificial intelligence we are all in.
6. We remain devoted and diligent to protect privacy and stay cyber safe —
we will do what it takes.
7. We know there are risks on the horizon that will eventually demand
our attention.
8. We are prepared for — though we are not predicting — a recession.

III. Public Policy
1. The American Dream is alive — but fraying for many.
2. We must have a proper diagnosis of our problems — the issues are real
and serious — if we want to have the proper prescription that leads to
workable solutions.
3. All these issues are fixable but that will happen only if we set aside partisan
politics and narrow self-interest — our country must come first.
4. Governments must be better and more effective — we cannot succeed without
their help. The rest of us could do a better job too.
5. CEOs: Your country needs you!
6. America’s global role and engagement are indispensable.

In this section I want to give the reader a comprehensive view of how we run the company.
We manage the company consistently with these principles in mind – and they have stood
the test of time. We also strive to satisfy and even exceed the requirements of our regulators and governments around the globe – and we think these principles are a critical
component of that.
1. First and foremost we look at our business from the point of view of the customer.
I. JPMORGAN CHASE PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES
Customer needs are what gets our attention.
We believe that in a hyper-competitive world
(from competitors known and unknown) the
best strategy – both offensive and defensive
– is to give the customer more: something
better faster or more efficiently. We are
always on a quest to improve our products
and services and for the most part this is
done with enhancements in technology and
through the continual training of our people.
Most fundamental of all is doing the right
thing for our customers – in all cases.
We energetically drive organic growth.
We continue to drive good and healthy
organic growth (meaning good customers
products and services they need and want
at fair and reasonable prices) and while
we are happy with our progress we recognize that we won’t meet every goal we set
for ourselves and can always do better. In
past letters we have identified many areas
of organic growth. Our achievements with
these initiatives are detailed in the CEO
letters in this Annual Report but a few of
the critical strategies are highlighted in the
sidebar below.
ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR LINES OF BUSINESS
Consumer &
Community
Banking
• By 2022 we expect 93% of the U.S. population to be in our Chase footprint
as we expand our branch network to new markets with an integrated
physical and digital approach. In addition to entering the Washington D.C.
Philadelphia and Boston markets in 2018 we recently announced nine new
markets for 2019 including Charlotte Minneapolis Nashville and St. Louis.
• The onboarding experience for new customers is being simplified.
Customers can open a new deposit account digitally in three to five minutes
functionality that added approximately 1.5 million new accounts since its
February 2018 launch; we’re expanding this functionality inside our
branches as well. We also recently announced Chase MyHome our new
digitally enabled mortgage fulfillment process that prefills applications for
our existing customers. It’s 20% faster than our paper-based process
allowing us to close a mortgage within three weeks. Our confidence in our
enhanced approach is reflected in our money-back guarantee.
11
• Customers recently began receiving personalized merchant offers and
discounts from ChaseOffersSM. This program ramped up rapidly with
customers activating 25+ million offers across 7 million cards in the initiative’s
first three months. CreditJourneySM with more than 15 million users enrolled
has also been a tremendously successful way to engage customers through
access to credit score information and identity protection.
• And later this year we’ll make it easier for our credit card customers to
borrow on their existing lines through two new products — My Chase PlanSM
allowing customers to finance a specific purchase at a reasonable cost at
the point of sale; and My Chase LoanSM letting customers borrow against
their unused credit limit and pay back their debt in fixed amounts at a
competitive rate. These products enable us to compete for the approximately
250 billion in card loans that our existing customers have with competitors.
Corporate &
Investment Bank
• We have been #1 in investment banking for the past decade and finished
2018 with 8.7% of global wallet share the industry’s best. Still we believe
we can increase our share over time as we continue to add bankers
selectively and leverage technology to provide better data and insights
to our clients.
• Our Treasury Services business grew revenue by 13% last year. As we
further implement our wholesale payments model which includes merchant
services we will be able to deliver a unique value proposition to our clients.
We see opportunities in every customer segment from middle market and
small businesses to large corporate clients and their business outside of
the United States.
• We have consistently grown share in Markets — including in businesses
where the wallet has shrunk. We are prioritizing investments in products
and technology to stay ahead of our clients’ needs. As companies expand
their businesses and acquire assets — increasingly across borders — our
global expertise in hedging risks and protecting capital can be as important
to them as the actual acquisition.
• Our Securities Services business has transformed itself into an industry
powerhouse and it sits alongside the world’s leading trading businesses. As
asset managers face ongoing pressures from passive investing and margin
compression in the coming years we think we have a unique opportunity to
help them become more efficient by outsourcing support functions and
using our innovative technology platforms.
• Our Corporate & Investment Bank is one of the few truly global businesses
in the financial services industry. As emerging countries take their place on
the global stage we will be there to support them. The investments we are
making in China and in other emerging markets today will result in our
international growth for years to come. 
12
Commercial
Banking
• Being able to deliver the broad-based capabilities of JPMorgan Chase at a
very local level is a key competitive advantage. Since launching our Middle
Market expansion efforts we are now local in 39 new markets and have
added 2800 clients resulting in 22% compounded revenue growth over the
last three years. Our growth potential for Middle Market business isn’t just
limited to our expansion markets. Through data-driven analysis we’ve
identified nearly 38000 prospective clients nationally. Some of our most
exciting opportunities are within our legacy markets like New York Chicago
Dallas and Houston where we have been for over a century.
• Chase’s retail branch expansion amplifies our opportunity to deepen
relationships with clients who already are in those markets by giving them
access to branches and the additional resources that come with that access.
In addition the expansion opens the opportunity to serve more public
sector customers in new U.S. markets through our Government Banking
business deepening community engagement and broadening our work with
cities states public universities and other municipal clients.
• Commercial Banking’s partnership with the Corporate & Investment Bank
continues to be highly successful and is a key growth driver for both
businesses. Being able to deliver the #1 investment bank locally enhances
our strategic dialogue with our clients and separates us from our
competitors. In 2018 39% of the firm’s North America investment banking
fees came from Commercial Banking clients totaling 2.5 billion in revenue
up from 1 billion 10 years ago. We expect that number to continue to grow.
Asset & Wealth
Management
• We are using data and technology to transform how we interact with clients.
By integrating our human expertise with distinctive digital offerings like You
Invest we have been able to attract new clients 89% of whom are first-time
investors with Chase.
• We are expanding our footprint to capture more of the opportunity across
the U.S. wealth management spectrum — from mass affluent (500000 to
3 million) to high-net-worth (3 million to 10 million) to ultra-high-networth (10 million or greater). By the end of 2019 we expect to have 6500
advisors globally on the ground where our clients need us most.
• We have continued to innovate our product lineup by adding 47 index funds
and exchange-traded funds (ETF) over the last three years.

2. We endeavor to be the best at anything and everything we do.
While we never expect to be best-in-class
every year in every business we normally
compare well with our best-in-class peers.
The chart below shows our performance
generally by business versus our competitors in terms of efficiency and returns.
On an ongoing basis we analyze and
compare ourselves with our competitors
at a very detailed level. The analysis we do
is on more than 50 sub-lines of business
and hundreds of products incorporating
not just financial data but also operational
data customer satisfaction and many other
measures. Our management will always be
very critical of its own performance: Acknowledging our shortcomings and mistakes and
studying them intensely and learning from
them make for a stronger company.

We also never lose sight of the fact that we
have an extraordinary number of strong
competitors – we cannot be complacent.
There are many capable financial technology (fintech) companies in the United
States and around the world – technology
always creates opportunities for disruption.
We have acknowledged that companies like
Square and PayPal have done things that we
could have done but did not. They looked at
clients’ problems improved straight through
processing added data and analytics to products and moved quickly. We recently sent
one of our senior teams to China to study
what’s being achieved there with artificial
intelligence (AI) and fintech and it’s hard
not to be both impressed and a little worried
about the progress China has made – it made
our management team even more motivated
to move quickly. Suffice it to say no matter
what our current performance is we cannot
rest on our laurels.

Hans Vestberg
Hans Vestberg 
Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer

I am deeply proud of all of the ways that my Verizon colleagues are making this world better every day.
Since becoming Verizon’s chief executive officer in August one of my top priorities has been to meet with our customers our employees and with you – our investors.

What I heard was inspiring. Over and over people expressed a deep pride in what Verizon stands for and in what we are achieving in the world.

As many of you have told me our company has unique strengths. These include our network leadership our dedication to serving our customers and our talented employees: the V Team.

By now you’ve all heard me say how excited I am about the future of our company. That optimism comes from my conversations with you. But it also comes from our actual performance and in 2018 those results were strong.

I also want to share another observation from my conversations over the past few months: I am more convinced than ever that Verizon can perform at an even higher gear. We are already one of the most successful companies in the world but we can be the very best.

Recently I outlined our plan to reach that level. I call it Verizon 2.0 – because it represents both a continuation of our proud past and a decisive step into a future that will demand much more of us.

I think of it as “building tomorrow with the best of today.”

To give you a sense of what this means I want to share with you our Verizon 2.0 2019 objectives.

First redouble our longstanding commitment to leadership in customer satisfaction.
While this list of priorities is not otherwise in rank order it’s not a coincidence that our customers are listed first. Verizon has the strongest customer loyalty in our industry and we fully intend to keep it that way. This requires a lot of very hard work day in and day out but we have the best team and are focused on building best-in-class digital experiences across all products and services for all customers.

Verizon’s customer-centered mentality has always been one of our core assets. If anything it will become even more essential as market competition and innovation cycles continue to accelerate.

We take this focus on the customer so seriously that we are reorganizing our entire company around it. As of April 2019 we will be built around three customer-facing operational groups: Verizon Consumer; Verizon Business; and Verizon Media which includes our content holdings.

Second deliver revenue and profitability growth and execute on process improvement initiatives.
We want to build on the momentum of our strong 2018 financial and operating results.

In 2018 we reported 2.5 million postpaid net additions highlighted by smartphone net additions of 2 million which were up 13 percent from the prior year. In 2018 we also significantly strengthened our balance sheet with full-year cash flow from operations totaling 34.3 billion up 10.0 billion year over year.

With the flexibility of our strong balance sheet we reduced total net debt by 4.7 billion invested 16.7 billion in capital for future growth and returned 9.8 billion to shareholders as our Board increased the dividend for the 12th year in a row.

Third expand our lead in 5G and set industry standards with our Intelligent Edge Network architecture.
As you know Verizon is far and away the established leader in 4G LTE wireless networks. In 2018 we widened our network leadership position and this was once again recognized by leading third-party evaluators. Customers rated Verizon a clear winner for the 11th year in a row according to the J.D. Power 2019 Wireless Network Quality Performance Study. We continue to lead in customer service customer loyalty and network performance which is why we remain the largest wireless carrier.

But in today’s tech marketplace “established leadership” isn’t enough. We’re surging ahead in 5G – a network technology more powerful than anything that has come before. In fact to call it a new generation of wireless is an understatement. This is the network that will enable broad-scale deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) and other Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies.

In 2018 Verizon was the first in the world to launch commercial 5G with residential broadband deployments beginning in Los Angeles Sacramento Houston and Indianapolis. In 2019 we will introduce mobile 5G.

Taken together our industry-standard 4G LTE and our unmatched 5G infrastructure form a wholly interoperable Intelligent Edge Network that is quite simply the most capable and resilient wireless platform in the world – a platform powerful enough to support the transformative business and consumer applications that are rapidly arriving on the market.

Network leadership also means building out our Network-as-a- Service (NaaS) solutions to deliver seamless experiences to any customer segment.

Verizon has long been a pioneer in offering customized infrastructure to help businesses carry out their own digital transformations and we are proud to be recognized by the respected industry-analysis firm Gartner once again as a leader for Network Services Managed Security Services and Unified Communications as a Service in its 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant reports.

That’s the 11th year in a row that Verizon has received the Gartner recognition for Network Services – and the sixth year in a row for Managed Security Services. But again established leadership isn’t enough for us. We are going to relentlessly advance in defining the frontiers of what NaaS can achieve for organizations across all sectors.

With our leading network as a foundation we plan to take our services above the network layer with Verizon Media and our IoT solutions including our telematics business and position ourselves to win in emerging growth industries.

Just like we want our business customers to have highly customized options we will insist on bringing our at-home customers a full range of personalized choices. That means building out our 5G Home and Yahoo programming content.

It also means drawing upon Verizon’s extraordinary technical and creative talent to generate new content optimized for the 5G future. This past September at Mobile World Congress Americas we showcased a whole new level of content – extended reality or XR. This represents the intersection of virtual reality (VR) augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR).

One demonstration by Envrmnt by Verizon showed how users wearing VR headsets were able to attend a concert involving an orchestra of about 100 instruments. As users moved through various sections of the auditorium they could hear different instruments at different levels just as they would in a real performance.

This is just one more example of how Verizon’s network leadership is translating into amazing new opportunities for our company – and for our customers.

In addition to prevail in today’s ever-evolving tech sector it’s vital to recognize that the next market-making idea could come from absolutely anywhere at any time. That means we have to do more than just open our door to outside innovation – we need to tear down our walls.

That’s why Verizon developed our 4G LTE Innovation Centers – and it’s why we established a 5G incubator in New York City at Alley a membership community for entrepreneurs. We recognize the immense value of collaboration between our internal teams and a diverse array of external partners large and small across an expanse of industries and capabilities. Since that time we broadened our portfolio of innovation centers with new 5G labs in four additional major centers of tech innovation: Palo Alto Los Angeles Washington D.C. and Greater Boston (Waltham MA).

These new labs will explore the boundaries of 5G technology; co-create new applications and hardware; and introduce our engineers and content creators to local trailblazers in industries ranging from entertainment and media to cybersecurity and emergency response.

Fourth foster a diverse organizational environment that embraces change sparks curiosity and encourages strategic risk taking.
Even as Verizon is committed to pulling in great ideas and collaborations from outside our organization we know the demands of the market also require us to develop a world- class internal creative capacity. If anything this will be the most important ingredient for success in the years to come.

Wireless attached things on street scene
Our goal has always been to improve lives through innovation.

The Evolution of Wireless Networks
At Verizon we define our shared purpose as follows: Deliver the promise of the digital world by enabling people businesses and society to innovate and drive positive change.

For us that begins within our own company with a staunch commitment to all forms of diversity. It means working in constructive partnership with our unions and employees worldwide – from the corporate office to the storefront. It means consciously creating a workplace where ideas and perspectives can circulate freely and where all employees are treated with dignity and respect.

Fifth carry forward Verizon’s commitment to responsible business practices and making the world a better place.
This isn’t a mere add-on to our “real work.” It’s a logical extension of our core business which is the empowerment of human connectivity and creativity. We call this “humanability” – our commitment to expanding the possibilities of people everywhere.

One way this manifests itself is in our Verizon Innovative Learning initiative which provides under-resourced students and schools with free technology free internet access and hands-on learning experiences to help them prepare for an increasingly tech-driven society.

Another way that 5G and other Verizon offerings contribute directly to a better world and a more inspiring future is through greater sustainability. For starters advanced sensor technology – embedded in everything from farmland to “intelligent asphalt” – is already helping communities and businesses make far more efficient use of energy and water resources.

Additionally 5G-driven applications like IoT and autonomous vehicles will enable companies of all sizes to design manufacture package distribute and reuse their products using less raw material fuel and waste.

Our connected solutions can also help our customers save energy and reduce their carbon footprint. We work with the Carbon Trust a respected nonprofit to measure the yearly reduction in CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions our customers are achieving through the use of our products and services.

I am deeply proud of all of the ways my colleagues are making this world better every day. We know it all starts with serving the customer and it culminates in our returns to you – the investors who make our business possible.

On behalf of everyone at Verizon we thank you and wish you a happy and healthy 2019.

2018 was year one of Restock Kroger our three-year plan to create shareholder value by pursuing our vision to
serve America through food inspiration and uplift.
I’m pleased to report that Kroger achieved what we set out to do last year. We delivered over 1 billion in savings
through cost controls and process improvements invested for the future and delivered against our operating profit and
cash flow goals.
Landing the first year of a three-year plan is always the toughest and most critical since everything that follows
depends on the foundation we’ve built. That foundation positions us to deliver on our 2020 Restock Kroger objectives
and transform the company for long-term growth.
Restock Kroger is our commitment our customers associates and communities. By serving these stakeholders
our shareholders are rewarded. We are investing for the future while also growing today. We are introducing new ways
to shop fresh foods to savor and new ways to save all so that our customers will love shopping with us. We are
investing in our associates more than ever before. We are establishing new ways to live our Purpose through Zero
Hunger | Zero Waste. And through it all we are reinventing the retail growth model. Together this will transform Kroger
for the better.
Of course transformational change is hard and we recognize that we have a lot of work to do. Just look at the
Fortune 500 list. You can count about a dozen companies that have truly transformed themselves in the last
10-15 years. And fewer than a quarter of the companies who were on the list 30 years ago are here at all today. But
transformation is an imperative and we are energized by that today just as we always have been throughout our
136-year history.
Stakeholder expectations continue to evolve. Customers want to shop on their terms for anything anytime
anywhere. Associates want more opportunities to grow both personally and professionally and to be a part of teams
that respect and care about them. Shareholders rightly want sustainable long-term growth and profitability – plus a
growing dividend. And all stakeholders want to know that we are inspired by purpose and motivated by a vision that
Kroger uniquely can deliver.
It’s an exciting time in the food retail industry. And even as the industry our stakeholders and our company
embrace change several things remain constant: our relentless commitment to customers our clarity of Purpose – To
Feed the Human Spirit and our customer Promise – everyone friendly and caring everything fresh uplift every way
and improve every day.
Restock Kroger has four main drivers: Redefine the Grocery Customer Experience Partner for Customer Value
Develop Talent and Live Our Purpose. Combined these drivers come together to Create Shareholder Value through
incremental operating profit and cash flow growth by 2020. Our long-term strategy and annual business plan are
reviewed and approved by Kroger’s engaged Board of Directors.
Redefine the Grocery Customer Experience
We are transforming Kroger to be the leading omnichannel retailer in the food industry.
Our customers don’t distinguish between an in store and online experience; rather they have a need or a problem
to solve and want the easiest most seamless solution. That could mean a delicious restaurant-style meal on the run a
meal kit for dinner tonight an online order for Pickup or Delivery to stock up on grocery essentials for the week a Ship
order of pantry and household staples … and the list goes on. We are rapidly expanding our capabilities to be relevant
available and accessible to our customers in both digital and physical environments.
We’ve been building Kroger’s digital platform for several years. We are very pleased with the growth of digital
sales which grew 58% in 2018. The annual run rate for digital sales was about 5 billion at the end of 2018. Going
forward we are trending toward a run rate of 9 billion.
We continue working to seamlessly integrate our growing digital platform with our brick-and-mortar grocery
business to serve customers anything anytime anywhere. At the end of 2018 we offered Pickup or Delivery to 91% of
Kroger households. By the end of 2019 with full integration of Kroger Ship into our ecosystem we will reach 100% of
America.
i
Our Brands continues to shine. Our portfolio of brands grew at a record-setting pace in 2018 even reaching 30.5%
unit share in the fourth quarter for the first time. Innovation remains a key driver of growth. We introduced 1022 new
items last year alone which helped drive strong year-over-year sales lift across Kroger Private Selection and Simple
Truth.
Simple Truth continued to outperform with double-digit sales growth in 2018. Simple Truth is now a 2.3 billion
brand. Designed to be a solution for customers who don’t want to have to examine the label to understand what is in
every product all Simple Truth items are free from more than 101 ingredients that customers told us they don’t want in
their food. And in 2018 we formed partnerships that offer new platforms to expand the brand’s reach even further
including our pilots with Walgreens and Alibaba’s TMall platform in China.
Partner for Customer Value
Transformation requires innovative partnerships. We are identifying partners who will help us deliver customer
value today and in the future.
We announced several exciting new partnerships in 2018 including Home Chef Microsoft Nuro and Ocado
among others. All of these partnerships accelerate our ability to provide customers anything anytime anywhere. And
each partner shares our passion for exploring the nexus between technology and innovative customer experiences.
I’d like to highlight two of these partnerships Home Chef and Ocado. We merged with Home Chef an online meal
kit company in 2018. What made Home Chef such a compelling merger partner is their combination of
technology-enabled culinary expertise and customer data driven decision making. Home Chef is #1 in customer
satisfaction among meal kit companies because they are relentlessly focused on the customer. They continue to grow
and shape the meal solutions category. Shortly after our merger Home Chef launched their first ever in-store meal kits.
Today the products are available in nearly 700 locations and we have plans for further expansion.
Our exclusive licensing agreement with Ocado one of the world’s largest dedicated online grocery retailers will
enable Kroger to provide a faster more curated ecommerce shopping experience for customers than ever before. The
Ocado Smart Platform utilizes advanced robotics and efficient automated warehouse technology to create an
end-to-end supply chain solution that will advance our already-strong supply chain infrastructure. What does that mean
for customers? Fresher food delivered faster to enjoy longer. We’ve identified the locations for the first three Ocado
customer fulfillment centers or ‘‘sheds’’ in the U.S. – southwest Ohio central Florida and the Mid-Atlantic region – and
will name additional locations in 2019.
Develop Talent
Transformation starts with our people which is why Develop Talent is a driver of Restock Kroger. Our talent
development strategy has three parts: investing in associates improving the associate experience and developing high
performing teams and leaders.
We are investing an incremental 500 million in our associates over the three years of Restock Kroger. In 2018
we accelerated these planned investments to increase wages for our store associates. The federal tax reform was a
catalyst enabling us to accelerate these investments. We chose to take a balanced approach to ensure tax reform
benefited our shareholders customers and associates alike. Shareholders are benefiting from approximately a third of
the tax savings flowing through to net earnings per diluted share. Another third of the savings is being reinvested to
improve the customer experience. And we are investing the final third to improve the associate experience through an
increased 401k match expanded associate discounts and a new industry-leading education assistance program called
Feed Your Future. Our combined efforts significantly improved employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets
in years.
Feed Your Future strengthens human capital by improving access to education. We launched the program a year
ago which is available to all associates full or part time after six months of service. Among all the participants 83%
are hourly store associates.
Many people’s first job is in retail. Kroger has always been a place where people can ‘come for a job and stay for a
career.’ And certainly our hope with programs like Feed Your Future is that associates will bring their educational
growth back to Kroger through increased performance and responsibility. But whether or not an associate remains with
Kroger for the long term we know that the investment we are making in them is going to last. It is going to give that
person a better life which is going to make the world a better place.
ii
Live Our Purpose
Increasingly customers associates and investors are choosing to shop with work for and invest in companies that
are purpose driven and making the world a better place. At Kroger our Purpose is to Feed the Human Spirit. And while
we live our purpose in large ways and small every day across our stores manufacturing plants distribution facilities
and offices one of the most innovative ways we Feed the Human Spirit is through our social impact plan Zero Hunger |
Zero Waste.
136 years in the grocery business have taught us a few things about people and about food. We know that meals
matter. Families that share meals together have children who do better in all aspects of their lives. Yet there is a
fundamental absurdity in the U.S. food system – 40% of the food produced here goes to waste while 1 in 8 Americans
struggle with hunger. In fact 1 in 6 children go hungry every day. That just doesn’t make sense.
We believe we can address this absurdity – perhaps better than anyone.
Zero Hunger | Zero Waste aims to end hunger in the places we call home and eliminate waste across the company
by 2025.
In 2018 we celebrated several milestones on our journey. Kroger donated more than 316 million meals in food and
funds to feed hungry families. That’s more than 100 million pounds of nutritious food directed to local Feeding America
food banks and enough to feed nearly 80000 food insecure people for a whole year. Our teams increased recycling by
nearly 20% across the company bringing total waste diversion to 76% as we work toward zero waste-to-landfill.
Also in 2018 Kroger became the first major U.S. retailer to commit to phasing out single-use plastic grocery bags
and transition to more sustainable options to better protect the planet. And we were thrilled to be recognized on Fortune
magazine's Change the World 2018 list for using Kroger’s scale for good – engaging our business to solve society’s
most complex issues – through Zero Hunger | Zero Waste.
We welcome you to join us on our journey too. You can follow along at www.thekrogerco.com or

Create Shareholder Value
We are transforming from a grocery company to a growth company.
We are creating a virtuous circle built on our grocery business and the data that business generates. We use data
both to serve our more than 60 million customers better and to create new business opportunities that leverage our
consumer insights.
We are improving our seamless ecosystem by offering customers incredible physical and digital experiences great
meals and amazing products friendly and caring associates and unprecedented convenience.
A constantly-improving customer ecosystem generates traffic customer data and insights.
These then fuel the growth of adjacent alternative profit streams like our Kroger Personal Finance 84.51° and
Media businesses. It is worth noting that each of these businesses beat their operating profit targets for 2018. This was
very encouraging because they are the biggest line items in our portfolio of alternative profit businesses.
It is a virtuous circle that works for customers and shareholders. Delivering an amazing customer experience creates
incremental new profit streams and new profit streams provide capital that can be reinvested in our core grocery business
making the seamless experience possible. Both parts are necessary to deliver sustainable long-term growth and profitability.
Strategic Sale of Assets
Throughout 2018 we explored strategic alternatives for several business units that had greater potential for growth
outside of the Kroger ecosystem. Those explorations resulted in the sale of our Convenience Store business YouTech
and Turkey Hill business. These transactions generated value for shareholders and will allow for each of these
businesses to reach their full potential. The sale of YouTech includes a long-term services agreement with Inmar to
provide digital coupon services to the Kroger family of stores and we will continue to offer our customers Turkey Hill’s
popular ice cream iced teas lemonades and other products.
***
iii
As America’s grocer Kroger has the winning combination of local presence plus a digital ecosystem enhanced by
strategic partnerships that together enable us to offer our customers anything anytime anywhere. We are deploying
our assets to serve more customers and create asset-light margin-rich alternative profit streams. We are living our
Purpose and pursuing our Restock Kroger vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift.
Very few Fortune 500 companies have transformed themselves since the list’s inception more than six decades
ago. But Kroger has done so time and again by always focusing on the ever-evolving needs of our customers. We will
transform because we have transformed repeatedly through our 136-year history.
When I think about Barney Kroger’s fledgling business on Pearl Street near the Ohio River delivering groceries to
customer homes by horse-drawn carriage … and compare that to our business in Houston delivering groceries to
customer homes by Nuro’s self-driving R1 robot … there are some dramatic differences but really it’s about the same
thing: delivering for our customers. It’s just a different kind of horsepower.

For our associates: Thank you for what you do every day for our customers the communities we call home and
each other.
For our shareholders and other stakeholders: On behalf of all of us thank you for your continued confidence in
Kroger.

I want this to be a document you can use as a reference for how
we plan to run GE for the long term. As the saying goes this is a
game of inches every day not feet or miles and I want us all to
keep score together. My goals are aligned with yours.
Like so many of you I have been a lifelong student of GE. My
earliest mentors cut their teeth at this company and much
of how I have operated and approached leadership and
teamwork throughout my career is rooted in GE’s own storied
management philosophy.
Coming into GE with this foundation from the outside has its
advantages. Someone with a fresh set of eyes can ask new
questions and look at challenges in a different way. We face a
number of hurdles but the entire team at GE is focused on tackling
our issues head on and making progress across multiple metrics.
In this letter I’ll walk you through the actions we are taking to
improve our financial position and strengthen our businesses.
It is clear we have work to do. In 2018 weak execution and
markets in Power were partially offset by strength in Aviation
and Healthcare. We took several charges related to Power and
finalized a 15 billion capital shortfall with our regulators related
to our run-off insurance business. We made major changes
to GE’s strategy portfolio leadership and board—my own
appointment included.
We are doing everything in our power to return GE to a position of
strength and we will need your support and patience to make sure
we do so. I am confident that we can for three reasons: our team
our technology and our global network.
First and most importantly is our team. One of the first things
I did as CEO was to begin to meet and talk with GE people. What I
found were talented colleagues from all over the world with grit
resolve and intelligence. They do not need any convincing that
how we operate must change. They are up for the fight and ready
to win—because GE matters.
We are doing everything in our power
to return GE to a position of strength
GE matters because our technology helps bring progress and
possibility to every corner of the planet—safely delivering people
where they need to go; powering homes schools hospitals and
businesses; and offering more precise diagnostics and care when
patients need it most. Our equipment and solutions are deployed
in two-thirds of the world’s commercial aircraft departures1
 more
than 2200 gigawatts of the world’s power generation capacity and
more than 4 million healthcare installations. This vast and valuable
installed base keeps us intimately involved with and often responsible
for the daily operations of our customers around the world constantly
helping us to better understand and serve their needs.

efficiency with our HA turbines in both 2016 and 2018.2
 And it is
why Healthcare helps doctors develop more precise diagnostics and
treatment that can give hope to patients whose diagnoses were
previously considered hopeless.
Many companies have strong talent and technology. But few also
operate with the depth and strength of GE’s global network.
We’ve built a local presence a strong brand and deep customer
relationships in more than 180 countries and we have invested
in emerging markets in Africa and Asia for more than 100 years.
We are proud to serve as true partners in their growth and
development—offering resources and experience investing
in local talent and supply chains and bringing other partners
along with us. These networks will continue to be our unique
competitive advantage as we pursue profitable cash-generating
growth for years to come.
With these strengths as our foundation we have a straightforward
plan to address our issues and define GE’s path forward focused
on two priorities.
1 Improve our financial position
First we are putting GE on firmer financial footing. Simply put we
have too much debt and we need to reduce it thoughtfully and
soon. Once we put our balance sheet in a healthier place we’ll be
in a better position to play offense across all our businesses.
We intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy targeting
a sustainable credit rating in the single-A range GE industrial
leverage of less than 2.5x net debt*-to-EBITDA a GE Capital
debt-to-equity ratio of less than 4-to-1 and ultimately a dividend
level in line with our peers.
This starts with reducing leverage at both our industrial
businesses and GE Capital and we have taken important steps
to get there. We completed substantially all of our 20 billion
industrial asset sale plan and we also announced the sale of
our BioPharma business to Danaher Corporation for more than
21 billion. We have more options available to us down the line
to generate cash to help bring down our leverage including our
remaining interests in Baker Hughes a GE company (BHGE)
2 62.22 percent combined-cycle net efficiency (at EDF Bouchain in 2016 with a 9HA.01) and 63.08 percent combined-cycle gross efficiency (at Chubu’s Nishi Nagoya in
2018 with three 7HA.01 turbines).
2018: Investing for
the Future Launched the LOGIQ E10 a next-generation radiology
ultrasound system integrating artificial intelligence cloud
connectivity and advanced algorithms to acquire and
reconstruct data faster than ever before—which helps
clinicians make a real difference in patient care.
Announced Reservoir battery energy storage
platform that delivers 5 percent higher
efficiency and reduced installation time
and costs.
and Wabtec Corporation and continued flexibility for our
go-forward Healthcare business. We also took the painful but
necessary action of reducing GE’s dividend allowing GE to retain
approximately 4 billion of cash per year compared to the prior
payout level.
Our strategy at GE Capital continues to center on de-risking
the balance sheet and reducing our assets to become a smaller
more focused business. We made strides in 2018 executing on
15 billion of our 25 billion asset reduction plan paying down
debt by 21 billion and enabling 10 billion of orders for our
industrial businesses. We also recently assessed the reserves we
hold for our run-off insurance business. We recorded an additional
reserve of 65 million after tax and consistent with what we laid
out last January we plan to contribute approximately 14.5 billion
of capital over seven years. We contributed 3.5 billion of this in
2018 and 1.9 billion in 2019.
Over time the biggest lever we have to improve our financial
position is to prioritize cash generation in each of our businesses.
To that end we are improving how we operationally manage cash
every day in every business and are using lean management
practices to improve working capital levels. For example our
Aviation team used lean and digital tools to improve average cycle
time for the LEAP-1B reducing the average engine assembly time
by 10 days or 36 percent. This led to lower inventory levels more
efficient throughput and ultimately more available cash.
We are also removing waste and increasing speed across our
supply chains—from our suppliers through our factories and field
service force and into our customers’ workflows. That helps our
partners and it helps us.
2 Strengthen our businesses
starting with Power
Our goal is to run more empowered accountable businesses that
are in the best possible position to create value for their customers
and improve top-line and bottom-line performance.

* Non-GAAP Financial Measure. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section on pages 70-77 of the Management s Discussion and Analysis within our Form 10-K
for explanations of why we use these Non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
'
We have strong fundamentals in many places from which to build.
Aviation had an outstanding 2018 expanding segment profit
by 20 percent. The team shipped over 1100 CFM International
LEAP engines—a remarkable achievement in just the third year
of production—and ended 2018 with more than 11000 units in
backlog. 2018 also marked entry into service for our Passport
engine and the first flight of the GE9X.
Revenue in Healthcare grew by 5 percent organically* driven
by growing demand in developed and emerging markets for
Healthcare Systems and continued growth in both biologics and
contrast agents in Life Sciences. Segment margins increased by
100 basis points on an organic basis* due to the team’s strong
productivity and execution.
Renewable Energy revenue grew by 4 percent in 2018 and
our onshore team was recognized as the No. 1 wind turbine
manufacturer in the United States in 2018 based on new installs.3
However profitability fell and we are focused on improving
margins by driving better productivity and reducing cost.
2019 will be a year of change for Power in particular. Power’s
challenges in 2018 were rooted in a combination of secular and
cyclical market pressures ongoing profit and cash pressures from
legacy contracts and some issues of our own doing. Going forward
we will continue aligning our cost structure with this new market
reality and we’ve eliminated some headquarter layers to improve
accountability and cost structures in underlying businesses.
We also need to run Power better improving how we manage
our inventory and material management product development
and delivery and billings and collections. For example by moving
responsibility for collections closer to the customer relationship
managers Power was able to improve its visibility to cash
and collect it earlier in the quarter. Where we used to get just
35 percent of our cash in the first two months of the quarter in
the fourth quarter Power increased this to 50 percent. This kind of
operational improvement takes hard work and it is a multi-year
journey but I’m encouraged by the Power team’s dedication
and progress.

powers Boeing’s new 777X and is designed to deliver
10 percent improvement in fuel efficiency compared
to the GE90-115B-powered Boeing 777-300ER.
For changes like these to truly take root our businesses need
to have more control over their decisions and rely less on the
corporate office. Broadly speaking if we want to run more
empowered and accountable businesses we need to radically
change how we operate across GE.
Part of this involves sharpening our focus. We are investing in
high-tech industries where we have large mission-critical installed
bases with high potential for aftermarket services and parts and
where our engineering manufacturing and service scale provide
competitive advantages.
This kind of work takes time. But it’s work
we can no doubt do
We announced plans to exit BHGE and Transportation to give
them greater control over their strategic direction and capital
allocation. The recently announced sale of our BioPharma business
gets us closer to a place where we aren’t spending so much of our
agenda tending to the balance sheet putting us on better footing
to consider the right options for Healthcare over time.

GE 2018 Annual Repo
We reorganized our Global Growth Organization and Global
Operations to serve local market and GE business needs more
efficiently. Going forward our center will be smaller and primarily
focused on strategy capital allocation research talent and
governance. In 2018 we reduced headquarters spend by over
400 million and we’re de-layering at both Corporate and
our businesses to improve accountability and visibility across
our teams.
Finally we’re reinventing how we work. GE has a long legacy of
operating rigor leadership development and innovation but our
recent performance has exposed some gaps. We are getting “back
to basics” by focusing on three main things:
• Put our customer at the center. As I’ve spent time with
customers in China the Middle East Europe and the United
States it’s become clear to me that what they value is
not always aligned with GE’s own metrics for success. For
example when I ask about quality internally I often hear
about our cost of quality which measures our issues rather
than how the customer experiences us. We need to shift our
lens back to the customer and work backward to improve
what matters to them. If we can do this successfully our own
growth and performance will follow. We can’t win unless our
customers win.
• Manage for operational performance first. This means
not just setting ambitious targets but also making sure we
have clear achievable paths to get there. I’ve been spending
lots of time in my reviews with the business leaders looking
at detailed operational metrics and processes so that we can
understand not just the “how much” of what we choose to do
but the “how.”
• Set fewer more impactful priorities. GE has ambition like
no other company I’ve seen. That’s mostly a good thing but
we need to focus our attention on the things that matter most
so we can move them the furthest. At the company level we
have committed to the two priorities I just outlined: Improve
our financial position and strengthen our businesses starting

our businesses.
This kind of work takes time. But it’s work we can no doubt do.
Path to growth
I am excited by the growth opportunities I see across GE’s markets.
In aviation markets demand for air travel continues to grow with
more than 4.5 billion passenger departures projected in 2019.4
Relatively low fuel prices enhance commercial airline profitability
and support continued operation of mature-fleet aircraft while
global defense spending is rising at its fastest rate in a decade.5
GE has provided groundbreaking propulsion technology for
100 years—since a Packard-Lepere biplane equipped with a GE
turbosupercharger climbed to nearly 30000 feet over McCook
Field in Dayton Ohio in 1919. Today GE Aviation’s engines
contain highly advanced technology including carbon composite
fan blades heat-resistant ceramic matrix composite (CMC)
components and 3D-printed metal parts designed to deliver
industry-leading performance reliability and durability.

Final thoughts
I’d like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to GE’s employees
customers alumni and Board for their commitment and passion
to advance this company forward. I’ve found inspiration in their
expressions of support (“we’re rooting for you!”) and offers to help
(“what can I do?”). We have work to do but we’ve identified clear
opportunities for improvement and are addressing them with
focus and energy.
Ernst Kraaij a GE Power leader wrote to me recently saying that
he felt GE’s attitude right now is reflected in the famous proverb
“the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.”
I think that Ernst is right. At times doing so can be painful but we
are embracing our reality and executing the plan we’ve laid out to
create value for our people for our customers and for you. Now it’s
more about what we do than what we say.
Thank you for the opportunity to earn your confidence and trust.

We are among the first to industrialize 3D-printing also known
as additive manufacturing which expands design capability
improves performance and simplifies manufacturing. We’ve
produced more than 30000 additive fuel nozzle tips for the CFM
LEAP engine and we’re expanding the use of additive on new
engines such as the GE9X Catalyst turboprop and T901. While
still an emerging technology additive manufacturing continues to
grow and it’s helping us make better products for our customers
at a scale few others have achieved.
In energy markets governments and utilities all over the world
face the challenge of bringing affordable reliable and sustainable
electricity to ever more people all while reducing emissions and
managing different fuel sources.
Now it’s more about what we do than
what we say
The energy mix continues to shift dramatically with roughly
two-thirds of global capacity additions through 2040 projected to
be in renewables. Meanwhile demand for natural gas is still on the
rise due in part to ample availability at low cost in markets like
the United States and increasing coal-to-gas switching especially
in emerging economies in Asia.7
GE is determined to lead this transition. We’re making bold bets in
clean energy while our turbines and technology allow customers to
quickly dispatch more reliable affordable fuels such as natural gas
when they are needed. Across our product portfolio we are using a
combination of hardware and software to grow our service offerings
and help utilities maintain and extend the life of their equipment.
Finally healthcare markets need increased capacity improved
productivity and better patient outcomes across the world. Aging
populations increasing chronic and lifestyle-related disease
accelerating demand for healthcare in emerging markets and
the increasing use of diagnostics and monitoring in patient care
continue to fuel demand for GE’s offerings. And our imaging agents
also help researchers improve clinical trials for new therapies by
helping identify the patients most likely to respond to innovative
new medicines.
It’s this kind of invention that is at GE’s heart and soul—in the
words of our founder Thomas Edison finding out what the world
needs and proceeding to invent it. And our Research Digital and
Additive teams reach across all GE’s industries to further boost
this capability. More than 1000 scientists at GE Research are
continuing to invent the future in these markets from artificial "

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fannie Mae and consolidated entities (in conservatorship)
(the “Company”) as of December 31 2018 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion because of the
effect of the material weakness identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria the Company
has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2018 based on the criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31 2018 of the Company and our
report dated February 14 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an
explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s dependence upon the continued support from various agencies of the
United States Government including the United States Department of Treasury and the Company’s conservator and
regulator the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Material Weakness
A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not 
Controls and Procedures
Fannie Mae 2018 Form 10-K 137
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in
management’s assessment:
• Disclosure Controls and Procedures - The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures did not adequately
ensure the accumulation and communication to management of information known to the Federal Housing Finance
Agency (as conservator) that is needed to meet their disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws as
they relate to financial reporting.
This material weakness was considered in determining the nature timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31 2018 of the Company and this report does not
affect our report on such financial statements.

Our earnings of 5.6 billion and earnings per share of 11.80 were our highest ever. We generated 7.6 billion of operating cash flow and rewarded our shareholders with strong distributions.

We increased our quarterly dividend 14 percent and repurchased 10 percent of shares outstanding returning 6.1 billion to shareholders. Since 2012 we have returned 22.5 billion to shareholders through dividends share repurchases and share exchanges reducing our initial shares outstanding by 30 percent.

What deserves equal attention is that we achieved these results while continuing our commitment to safe reliable and environmentally sustainable operations. We also gave back to the communities where we live and work through direct financial support and volunteerism by our employees.

In an industry facing increasing scrutiny on environmental safety human capital and governance issues we proactively work to turn risks into opportunities:

Our combined workforce total recordable rate was 0.14 matching last year’s record low rate.
Refining’s Tier 1 process safety event rate of 0.02 is industry-leading.
For the second year in a row one of our refineries received the AFPM’s Distinguished Safety Award the highest annual safety recognition in the industry.
We invested over 900 million to fund reliability safety and environmental projects.
We provided 27 million in financial support to organizations promoting education environmental sustainability and community safety and preparedness.
Our employees volunteered 78000 hours of their time to hundreds of charitable and service organizations during the year.
Below are highlights from our business segments each of which performed well in 2018.

Midstream achieved record earnings in 2018 driven by growth projects completed and placed into service during the past two years. As part of our strategy we are developing pipelines to link the key shale basins to the Gulf Coast expanding export capability from strategic Gulf Coast terminals and building out our integrated NGL value chain. During 2018 we expanded storage capacity at our Beaumont Terminal to 14.6 million barrels. The 900000-BPD Gray Oak Pipeline will transport crude oil from the Permian and Eagle Ford to the U.S. Gulf Coast upon completion by the end of this year. At the Sweeny Hub we are adding 300000 BPD of fractionation capability expected to be completed in late 2020.
In our Chemicals business CPChem’s new U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical assets are running well and generating strong free cash flow. The ethane cracker has consistently operated above design rates and its capacity was recently increased to 3.8 billion pounds per year 15 percent above its original design capacity. CPChem is pursuing further petrochemical opportunities to meet the growing global demand for polymers including a second Gulf Coast project that would include ethylene and derivative capacity.
In Refining we ran well across our integrated system and captured strong margins from advantaged crude feedstocks. We completed fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit modernization projects at our Bayway and Wood River refineries to increase clean product yield. At our Sweeny Refinery we started an FCC unit upgrade to increase production of higher-value petrochemical products and higher-octane gasoline.
Our Marketing business delivered solid margins through efficient off-take of our refining production. We continue to enhance our U.S. fuels brands through the re-imaging of sites bringing the total number since the program’s inception to approximately 2600. In Europe we are growing and enhancing our retail sites and added 20 new sites in 2018.
We thank our employees for successfully executing the company’s strategy to deliver strong 2018 results. Our high-performing organization is defined by culture capability and performance. Phillips 66 employees embrace our core values of safety honor and commitment and we hold ourselves accountable to the highest ethical standards.

We are optimistic about the opportunities across our businesses. We have the right strategy portfolio and talent in place to compete and deliver superior value to shareholders. Through our ongoing commitment to operating excellence returns-focused growth and disciplined capital allocation we are confident that the best is yet to come for Phillips 66.

financial results while maintaining its
unrelenting focus on operations excellence
— enabling safe reliable and environmentally
responsible operations.
For the year adjusted net income attributable
to stockholders was 7.37 per share compared
with 4.96 per share in 2017. We matched our
2017 record for process safety performance and
we continued to outperform the industry on our
personnel injury rates.
We also delivered on our commitment to
invest in growth projects and acquisitions that
increase Valero’s earnings capability while
maintaining solid returns to our stockholders.
The logistics investments we made over the last
several years are contributing significantly to
earnings.
In November 2018 the boards of directors
of Valero and joint-venture partner Darling
Ingredients Inc. approved another expansion of
our Diamond Green Diesel plant.
In 2018 we paid to stockholders 54 percent
of our annual adjusted net cash provided by
operating activities exceeding our target annual
payout range of 40 percent to 50 percent.
Our solid financial position and a favorable
outlook for our business enabled us to further
demonstrate our commitment to our investors
as our board in January 2019 approved a
12.5 percent increase in the regular quarterly
dividend to 0.90 per share or 3.60 annually.
Also in January we closed the acquisition of
Valero Energy Partners. This transaction was
immediately accretive and has simplified our
structure.
Our disciplined capital allocation framework
continues to drive our ability to balance growth
and cash returns for our stockholders. We
prioritize maintaining our investment-grade
credit ratings and non-discretionary spending
to sustain our business and grow our dividend.
Growth through projects or acquisitions and
incremental cash returns compete for remaining
discretionary cash flow. We continue to receive
positive feedback from our stockholders on
our framework and adherence to it and we are
committed to it going forward.
With a healthy economy a year-over-year
increase in vehicle miles traveled and affordable
fuel prices we are encouraged for 2019. We
expect good demand for our products in
domestic and export markets this year.
Adding to our optimism are expected
incremental diesel demand and discounts for
sour crude-oil feedstock associated with the
impending global marine bunker fuel sulfur
reduction standards.
We believe that our outstanding team’s ability
to optimize our system’s flexibility to process a
wide range of feedstocks and reliably supply
quality fuels positions Valero well for whatever
opportunity the market presents to us.

As I reflect on our progress this past year I first want to say thank you for your commitment and investment in Microsoft. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished together as we innovate and help customers navigate their digital transformation and I am even more optimistic about the opportunity ahead.

We are living at a crucial time in history where the impact of technology on every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy is more acute than ever before. It is incumbent upon leaders of our industry to ensure that the technology we build always creates opportunity. Too often we celebrate technology disruption for the sake of disruption without reflecting on its unintended consequences. What the world needs is technology that benefits people and society more broadly and is trusted.

Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our business model is dependent on our customers’ and partners’ success. We are grounded in creating local economic opportunity in every community helping to unlock the power of technology to address our customers’ most pressing challenges. Our platforms and tools enable creativity in all of us. They help drive small-business productivity large business competitiveness and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups improve educational and health outcomes and empower human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers’ success.

Our culture enables us to pursue our mission with a growth mindset. It’s a continuous practice of learning renewal and having the courage to confront our own fixed mindsets. Collectively we are moving from a group of people who know it all to a group of people who want to learn it all. To achieve our mission we must reflect the diverse perspectives and experiences of our customers around the world. We must have a deep sense of their unmet and unarticulated needs. Each day we are pushing ourselves to be more customer obsessed to be more diverse and inclusive and to operate as One Microsoft — ultimately to make a bigger difference in the world.

OPPORTUNITY AND IMPACT

One of the greatest privileges I have as CEO of Microsoft is seeing firsthand the incredible impact our technologies have on people and organizations around the world. Our ecosystem touches the lives of billions of people every single day creating new opportunity for our customers and partners and positively impacting local communities.

In Kenya our partner M-KOPA Solar has connected hundreds of thousands of homes across sub-Saharan Africa to solar power for the first time using the Microsoft Cloud innovating with a pay-as-you-go model that helps households living on less than 2 a day establish a credit history. In Arizona we are applying Dynamics 365 to improve outcomes among one of the state’s most vulnerable populations — the more than 15000 children in foster care. In Poland MedApp is using HoloLens to help cardiologists visualize a patient's heart as it beats — in real time — reducing the amount of time they then need to perform open-heart surgery. In Kona Hawaii Jack’s Diving Locker is using Microsoft 365 to connect its 50 employees across land and sea so that they can focus on what they do best — protect pristine coral reefs and take people diving. In Washington state Karrick Johnson an 8-year-old with dyslexia avoided reading in class until he started using our Learning Tools. And in Cambodia underserved children in rural communities are learning to code with Minecraft opening doors to futures that would have previously been unimaginable.

Across the globe enterprise customers in every industry — from iconic brands like Coca-Cola Company and Chevron Corporation to ZF Group a car parts manufacturer in Germany — are using our technology to build their own digital capability so they can thrive in a world where every company is a software company. Walmart — the world’s largest company by revenue and its biggest private employer — chose Azure and Microsoft 365 to fuel its digital transformation transforming the shopping experience for customers and empowering their more than 2 million associates to do their best work.

In sum our platforms create broad surplus everywhere from the farmer who is able to apply precision agriculture to conserve resources and increase yields to the hospital that is able to lower the cost of healthcare and improve patient outcomes to the largest companies of the world reaching new customers in new markets.

RESULTS AND PROGRESS

The breadth and depth of our mission and the trust customers are placing in us to power their digital transformation enable us to have this broad impact — and it is fueling our results. 

In fiscal 2018 we delivered 110.4 billion in revenue and 35.1 billion in operating income and returned 21.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Our commercial cloud business delivered more than 23 billion in revenue exceeding the ambitious goal we had set to achieve 20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue by the end of fiscal 2018 nine months ahead of schedule. In addition we expanded our commercial cloud gross margin to 57 percent up 7 points year-over-year.

These are strong results — and yet the opportunity ahead in a world powered by an intelligent cloud and edge is unprecedented. Imagine a future where all of your apps and experiences revolve around you and transcend any single device; where data in any form is analyzed in real time so that computers can anticipate and even act on your behalf and augment what you would otherwise be able to accomplish on your own. And where computing is more distributed and embedded in the world from intelligent digital assistants at work on the go and in your home that you can communicate with in a myriad of ways — voice eyes or gestures — to oil rigs that adjust production in real time as demand fluctuates in global markets.

Across each of our customer solution areas we are broadening our offerings and accelerating our innovation to capture the opportunities this new era will create for our customers and better meet their unarticulated needs.

Modern Workplace
We expanded our Microsoft 365 offerings to reach new audiences and empower more employees for the modern workplace protecting data from increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and delivering secure productivity and collaboration tools. Already a multi-billion-dollar business Microsoft 365 gives customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and under-penetrated markets — from Fortune 500 enterprises to small businesses to more than 2 billion firstline workers. More than 135 million people use Office 365 commercial every month and Outlook Mobile is helping people be productive and stay secure on more than 100 million iOS and Android devices worldwide — with AI-infused experiences they use every day. Microsoft Teams has rapidly become the hub for teamwork and is being used by more than 300000 organizations of all sizes including 87 of the Fortune 100. Windows 10 is now active on nearly 700 million devices around the world. And we continue to create new device categories with always-on always-connected Windows 10 PCs and an expanded family of Surface devices including the new Surface Go — setting the bar for the industry.

Business Applications
Every process inside a business is being digitized and we are winning customers with our differentiated approach enabling organizations of all sizes to digitize critical business functions — from sales to marketing to HR. Dynamics 365 is the alternative to monolithic siloed suites of business applications with modular extensible and AI-driven apps that are part of a connected data graph and unlock insights across every part of the organization. Net seats grew 52 percent year-over-year and our investments in Power BI have made Microsoft the leader in business analytics in the cloud. Our recently announced Open Data Initiative with Adobe and SAP will enable our customers to take control of their data and build new experiences that truly put people at the center. And we are innovating with HoloLens and mixed reality to create immersive experiences that digitize physical spaces and interactions to transform training collaboration and design for firstline workers who account for 80 percent of the world’s workforce. 

LinkedIn is the essential platform to connect the world’s professionals and create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. LinkedIn now has more than 575 million members and we are continuously innovating to give them new ways to connect and engage with one another — from increasing the relevancy of the LinkedIn Feed to a better mobile experience to introducing new video and messaging capability. And we are transforming how companies manage talent training and sales and marketing with new solutions powered by the LinkedIn and Microsoft Graphs. Dynamics 365 for Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives HR professionals a complete solution in an increasingly competitive talent marketplace and deep integration of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 redefines social selling enabling sales professionals to dramatically increase their effectiveness by drawing on the relationships in their personal networks. We will continue to innovate across the LinkedIn platform to add new value for members and customers.

Applications and Infrastructure
To thrive in the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge customers need a consistent computing stack from the cloud to the edge. Azure is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity data application platform and security and management — and this architectural advantage is increasingly clear to our customers. Azure revenue grew 91 percent year-over-year.

And we are investing aggressively to build Azure as the world’s computer. We expanded our global datacenter footprint to 54 regions — more than any other cloud provider — and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry to meet evolving regulatory needs creating broader economic benefit and opportunity in local markets on six continents. With Project Natick we even innovated beyond land experimenting with a full-scale subsea zero emissions datacenter with the promise of setting new standards for datacenter provisioning latency and sustainability.

We added nearly 500 new Azure capabilities in the past year alone focused on both existing workloads and new workloads such as IoT and Edge AI. IoT is transforming the rules of manufacturing retail and oil and gas — fueling cloud and edge innovation accelerating the evolution of digital factories and enhancing supply-chain performance. Azure IoT and Azure Stack — a first-of-its-kind cloud-to-edge solution — enable customers and partners to build IoT solutions that run at the edge so people from the factory floor to the retail store to the oil rig can manage devices and analyze data in real time. We introduced Azure Sphere another first-of-its-kind highly secure edge solution that combines chip design an IoT operating system and a cloud service to secure the more than 9 billion microcontroller-powered devices entering the market each year — from kitchen appliances to industrial equipment. It’s an incredible example of how we are helping our customers realize the promise of a world of connected devices and things. And our ambition extends beyond today’s computers to quantum computing to take us beyond the limitations of traditional transistor-based computers and enable entirely new scenarios. We first unveiled our vision for quantum last year and we are already seeing customers apply our quantum-inspired algorithms to address some of their most pressing challenges.

Data and AI
Our customers will increasingly need to build their own AI to extract insights from the ever-increasing amount of data they collect — and we are investing to make Azure the best cloud for their comprehensive data estates. We are democratizing data science and AI with Azure Cognitive Services Azure Machine Learning and data services such as Azure Cosmos DB — the first globally distributed multi-model database — to help organizations of all sizes convert their data into insights and experiences for competitive advantage. In less than a year Azure Cosmos DB has already exceeded 100 million in annualized revenue. Azure Database for MySQL and PostgreSQL makes it even easier to bring open source-powered applications to Azure expanding our opportunity in this space. And we are seeing rapid customer adoption of Azure Databricks for data preparation advanced analytics and machine learning scenarios. We are leading in the field of AI research achieving human parity with object recognition speech recognition machine reading and — this year — language translation. But that is not enough. We are committed to translating these breakthroughs into toolsets our customers can use. More than 1 million developers have already used our Cognitive Services to quickly and easily create AI applications. Our Azure Bot Service has nearly 300000 developers and we are driving new advances in our underlying cloud infrastructure building the world’s first AI supercomputer in Azure. Microsoft Translator brings AI-powered translation to developers where their data is whether in the cloud or on the edge. Our pending acquisition of GitHub recognizes the increasingly vital role developers will play in value creation and growth across every industry and will enable us to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos.

Gaming
We are pursuing an expansive opportunity in gaming — from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed — surpassing 10 billion in revenue this year for the first time. We are investing aggressively in content community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement with gamers. Xbox Live now has 57 million monthly active users and we are investing in new services like Mixer — which blurs the line between watching and playing — and Game Pass our new unlimited subscription service. The addition of five new gaming studios this year bolsters our first-party content development to support our fast-growing gaming services. And our acquisition of PlayFab accelerates our vision to build a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry across mobile PC and console. I’m excited about our opportunity in the fast-growing 100 billion gaming market and what’s to come.

TRUST AND RESPONSIBILITY

At a time when digital technology is transforming every industry and every part of our daily life and work our customers are increasingly looking for a partner whose business interests are fundamentally aligned with their own. At Microsoft our customers’ interests are core to our success. That is what engenders trust.

This commitment extends to instilling trust in technology across everything we do. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right which is why compliance is deeply embedded in all our processes and practices. We extended the data subject rights that are at the heart of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to all our customers around the world not just those in the European Union and advocated for the passage of the CLOUD Act in the U.S.

Cybersecurity is the central challenge of the digital age and we are innovating to provide end-to-end security for our customers with security operations at global scale that analyze more than 6.5 trillion security signals each day enterprise-class technology and broad cybersecurity partnerships for an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. We led the Cybersecurity Tech Accord which has been signed by 61 global organizations and are calling on governments to do more to make the internet safe. We announced the Defending Democracy Program to work with governments around the world to help safeguard voting and introduced AccountGuard to offer advanced cybersecurity protections to political campaigns in the U.S.

And as we make advancements in AI we are asking ourselves tough questions — like not only what computers can do but what should they do. That’s why we are investing in tools for detecting and addressing bias in AI systems and advocating for thoughtful government regulation.

We also have a responsibility as a company to empower everyone to fully participate in our society and economy using technology. We are working with governments the private sector and local nonprofit organizations around the world to make this vision a reality. We donated more than 1.4 billion in software and services in fiscal 2018 via Microsoft Philanthropies helping nonprofits get access to the technology they need to drive greater impact and in calendar year 2017 our employees donated a record 158 million (including company match) through our employee giving program to support nonprofits in local communities.

We are putting AI tools into the hands of change-makers to address society's most pressing challenges with new programs like AI for Earth a five-year 50M commitment to environmental sustainability and AI for Accessibility to benefit the more than 1 billion people with disabilities around the world. I am inspired by how teams across Microsoft are galvanized around inclusive design and accessibility — and producing tangible results with new features and offerings for Microsoft 365 Office 365 Windows and Xbox designed to meet the needs of people with disabilities.

Finally we know that the jobs of today will not be the jobs of tomorrow and are investing to provide today’s workforce and future generations with the digital skills they will need to succeed partnering with nonprofit organizations across 54 countries to provide computer science learning experiences to millions of young people around the world and expanding our TEALS program in high schools across the U.S.

I’m proud of our progress and I’m proud of the more than 100000 Microsoft employees around the world who are focused on our customers’ success in this new era. We have long recognized that the health wellbeing and diversity of our employees help Microsoft succeed. That’s why we provide industry-leading benefits for our employees including comprehensive health and wellness programs for families paid vacation paid sick leave and paid time off for new parents. We were one of the first companies to require our U.S. suppliers doing substantial business with us to provide paid time off for their employees. And this year we took a further step to ensure that these suppliers also provide their employees with paid parental leave.

Over the past year we have made progress in building a diverse and inclusive culture where everyone can do their best work. Since FY16 we have nearly doubled the number of women corporate vice presidents at Microsoft — both overall and in technical roles. We’ve increased African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino representation by 33 percent. And this past fiscal year more than half of our U.S. interns were women or African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino. We must keep pushing to do more and representation is only one measure of progress. Creating a diverse and inclusive workplace at Microsoft is everyone’s job. And this year we increased our commitment ensuring that every leader and employee prioritizes diversity and inclusion as part of our annual performance review process.

In closing we will continue to create local opportunity growth and impact in every community and country around the world. We will continue to invest in the largest growth opportunities and innovate boldly to serve our customers. We will continue to help our customers build digital capability so they can grow and thrive — today and long into the future. We will continue to work to instill trust in technology across everything we do to advocate for customer privacy drive industry-wide cybersecurity initiatives and champion ethical AI. And we will continue to transform our culture to reflect the diverse customers we serve around the world while holding fast to our timeless values.

Last spring I visited our AI School in Paris France which we started earlier this year to provide immersive training to help close the skills gap. Students from different backgrounds and walks of life with no prior technical experience are learning new data science skills. They take an intense seven month class followed by an apprenticeship at one of our local partners — and are ready for new careers in AI and data science. While there I met Cassandra Delage a young entrepreneur with an ambitious dream of reimagining recycling. Her company Plast’if has created what might be best described as a “recycling vending machine.” You take plastic put it in the machine and it’s converted into a useful object you can take with you. She built it with students at the AI School creating an ML model that recognizes the plastic deploying it on an inexpensive computer and then integrating it with a 3-D printer — turning her novel idea into reality.

It’s just one example of how technology can help create new opportunity and build a better future for everyone.

And it’s just the start — I could not be more optimistic about what’s yet to come.

Your Board and management team are committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. This
commitment is reflected in our core values which provide the foundation for our business and reflect the culture
that was built by our founders nearly 40 years ago. We would like to highlight for you some actions we took in
fiscal 2018 to ensure we are optimizing our governance practices to support continued value creation over the
long term.
Strategic Engagement and Oversight. At our December 2017 Investor and Analyst Conference we outlined
our long-term plan to create the One Home Depot experience including a multi-year investment of approximately
11 billion. The Board’s engagement with management to address both the short-term needs and long-term
strategies necessary to meet our customers’ expectations in a rapidly evolving retail landscape helped to shape
this plan and to continue to refine it as the Company began to execute on the plan in fiscal 2018. Company
strategy is discussed regularly at Board meetings and directors annually participate in an in-depth strategy
session with management. Through these strategy sessions we tap into the ideas viewpoints and experiences
of our diverse and highly-skilled board members.
Director Refreshment and Recruiting. We have continued to focus on Board refreshment to align our Board’s
strengths with the evolving retail landscape. New director Stephanie Linnartz who serves as the Executive Vice
President and Global Chief Commercial Officer for Marriott International joined us in May 2018. She provides
us with a significant source of expertise as we roll out the One Home Depot experience given her critical role
in developing the customer experience at Marriott. We also added Manuel Kadre Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of MBB Auto Group to our Board in October. His service on other boards and management expertise
has further enhanced our Board’s financial strategic environmental and real estate experience. After 11 years
of service Armando Codina will be retiring from the Board at the end of his current term at the annual meeting
in May. Mark Vadon has also decided to step down at the end of his current term in May after serving on our
Board for six years. Both have been valued members of our Board and we deeply appreciate their service to
The Home Depot and our shareholders.
Shareholder Engagement and Governance. The Board and management carefully analyzed the results of
the voting at the 2018 annual meeting and at the Board’s direction the Company initiated an expanded
environmental social and governance engagement program with our institutional shareholders. After taking into
account feedback from those engagements combined with the Company’s commitment to governance best
practices the Board approved several changes. In late 2018 we enhanced our disclosure of our Company’s
diversity providing statistics on our website about the ethnic and gender diversity of our U.S. workforce. This
disclosure will become part of our annual Responsibility Report going forward. In February 2019 we reduced
the percentage of outstanding shares required to call a special meeting of shareholders from 25% to 15% and
updated our executive compensation clawback policy to specifically include conduct that causes significant
reputational harm to the Company.
Underpinning all of these actions is a commitment to our shareholders which is in turn embodied in the shareholder
return principles that we have consistently outlined for our investor community. By following these principles we
were able to return value to our shareholders in fiscal 2018 through a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend
and 10.0 billion in share repurchases.
We hope you will be able to join us at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Thursday May 23 2019.
You will find information about the Meeting including the matters to be voted on at the Meeting in the enclosed
Notice of Meeting and Proxy Statement. The Meeting will also include a report on the Company’s performance
and operations and a question and answer session. On behalf of our over 400000 associates and our Board
we thank you for your support of The Home Depot.

We are steadfast in
our commitment to
building and protecting
the long-term value
of the company.
Looking back on my first year as chair of the
Wells Fargo Board of Directors I am encouraged
by the progress the company and our board
have made as we build a better Wells Fargo for
the future.
Before I talk about the board I’d like to recognize
the tireless efforts of our management team.
Tim Sloan became CEO just over two years ago
and since then with the full support of the board
he has been driving transformational change
at the company.
As CEO Tim’s first priority was to initiate an
extensive review to identify understand and
resolve the problems of the past; to provide
appropriate remediation to customers who
were harmed; and to be transparent about our
progress. We discovered a variety of issues and
even though the specific causes may have been
different some common themes emerged such
as the company’s history of running businesses
individually and the decentralized nature of
certain control functions. I believe this review
was necessary to help us serve our customers
better. In the past two years we have centralized
many aspects of our organizational structure
strengthened risk management and improved
governance practices and oversight. Going
forward we believe maintaining a holistic view
of the company and focusing on operational
excellence will result in continued positive change.
Organizationally Tim has pulled together a
strong management team that blends Wells Fargo
veterans with experienced talent from elsewhere.
Three of his direct reports are from outside
the company and two more — the company’s
new head of Technology and chief auditor — will
join Wells Fargo in April. Most of his other direct
reports are in new or expanded roles. Together

OVERSIGHT
Our board oversight in 2018 focused heavily
on identifying understanding and resolving
issues within the company including
concerns identified by our regulators.
We are also looking to the future. In his letter
to shareholders Tim details management
strategies to achieve our six company goals
of becoming the financial services leader in
customer service and advice team member
engagement innovation risk management
corporate citizenship and shareholder value.
Going forward board oversight of those
goals will emphasize the following:
Meeting regulatory expectations.
We recognize the importance of fully
satisfying regulatory expectations. We
are specifically focused on satisfying the
requirements of the company’s outstanding
consent orders. But more broadly we are
enhancing our risk and reporting systems
to meet the heightened regulatory
expectations for systemically important
financial institutions and our own goal of
industry leadership in risk management.
We are engaging in frequent and open
communication with our regulators about
our progress.
Enhancing risk management.
Wells Fargo has been and remains an
industry leader in credit market and
liquidity risk management. Over the years
the company has demonstrated an ability
to manage through difficult economic
conditions including the 2008 financial
crisis but management of compliance and
operational risks needed improvement.
We have new leadership in the chief risk
officer chief compliance officer head of
Regulatory Relations and chief operational
risk officer roles. They have developed and
are busy implementing plans to continue
building our operational and compliance
risk management systems to a level that
matches our business structure and
strategies. These plans include enhancing
management-level governance committee
structures oversight monitoring and
controls and escalation processes and
procedures. Our objective is to build an
industry-leading risk management program.
Operational excellence. Many of our past
operational risk problems stemmed from
weaknesses in underlying operations.
In 2018 management launched a project
to inventory and map all our business
processes. While identifying risk areas

operations. We expect this work to
improve the customer and team member
experience reduce operating costs and
enhance risk management.
Oversight of culture and human capital
management. We continue to assess
and shape the company’s culture with
an emphasis on such areas as ethics
training and development and diversity
and inclusion. One of the guiding values
of Wells Fargo is “people as a competitive
advantage.” We expect to devote a
substantial amount of board attention to
talent management strategies including
plans to attract retain reward develop
and care for the very best people available.
We recognize the importance of rewarding
outstanding performance and holding
team members accountable.
Technology. New generations of customers
and team members expect technology to
work seamlessly and intuitively. Thoughtful
use of emerging technologies can enable
quantum leaps in innovation and efficiency.
At the same time cyber risk is at an all-time
high. We want to make sure all our systems
operate on up-to-date platforms are able to
process and protect massive amounts of data
and contribute to our vision of operational
excellence and leadership in innovation.
We have already made progress in each
of these areas and we will continue to focus
on them in 2019.
STAKEHOLDER INTERACTION
For the past several years our independent
directors have participated in a shareholder
engagement program to help us better
understand our shareholders’ views on key
corporate governance and other topics.
The candid feedback of our shareholders
helps us define priorities assess progress
and enhance our corporate governance
practices. In 2018 I met with shareholders
representing more than 35 percent of our
company’s common stock to discuss our
governance approach.
Our board is also focused on corporate
citizenship which is overseen by the board’s
Corporate Responsibility Committee.
The committee reviews environmental and
social governance practices and policies.
Following our 2018 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders Corporate Responsibility
Committee members met with members
of our external Stakeholder Advisory Council
to seek feedback and insights on current
and emerging issues important to them.
Tim and I continued to meet with the council
during the year to discuss such varied topics
as mortgage lending services for unbanked or
underbanked consumers our efforts to help
customers avoid and reduce overdraft fees
environmental commitments human rights
and reputational risk issues.
One of our most significant responses to
shareholder feedback was the publication of
a Business Standards Report on our website
in early 2019. The report was the culmination
of engagement with a group of stakeholders
led by the Interfaith Center on Corporate
Responsibility which requested the report.
The report discusses our business practices and
the many fundamental changes we have made — 
and continue to make — as we transform our
company. The report also details what we have
learned and what we have changed as we work
to improve the company and rebuild trust.
I encourage you to read it.
“ The entire board remains
excited and optimistic about
Wells Fargo.”
LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE
Over the past few years management and the
board have devoted a substantial amount of time
and attention to the problems we have found
in our company. Finding fixing and atoning for
those problems is necessary to build our future
on a strong foundation and is required to meet the
expectations of our regulators and regain the
trust of our customers team members and the
public. Through it all we have also delivered solid
financial performance. The company earned
$22.4 billion in 2018 or $4.28 per diluted
common share the highest earnings per share
in the company’s history. Our ability to sustain
solid financial performance in the face of our
recent challenges is a testament to the fi nancial
durability provided by our core franchise and
diversified business model.
Our capital levels are well in excess of regulatory
minimums. As part of the company’s goal of
delivering long-term shareholder value we’re
committed to returning capital to shareholders
when appropriate. During 2018 we returned a
record $25.8 billion in capital to shareholders
through common stock dividends and net share
repurchases representing a 78 percent increase
from 2017. In January 2019 we increased the
quarterly common stock dividend from 43 cents
to 45 cents per share.
We do not take our strengths for granted.
We intend to continue to strengthen risk
management streamline and simplify
operations and innovate responsibly so we
can build on our strengths. The goal of all
these efforts is to become even more customerfocused innovative and better positioned for
the future — creating long-term value for
our shareholders.
IN APPRECIATION
On behalf of the directors of your company
thank you for choosing to invest in Wells Fargo
and for your continued faith in the future of our
company. Even though much work remains we
believe we are on the right path and are making
real progress. We are confident we have a CEO
and management team with the vision and
strategy to achieve our goals — and to fix the
problems of the past while building a strong
foundation for the future. The changes the
company is making are showing positive signs
and we are confident in our success.
I encourage you to carefully review this
report our 2019 proxy statement and the
other materials the company makes available
to shareholders to better understand the
opportunities and challenges ahead and
Wells Fargo’s work to execute its strategy.
We are steadfast in our commitment to
building and protecting the long-term value
of the company.
The entire board remains excited and
optimistic about Wells Fargo.

30,Citigroup,97120,32,87966,209000,Michael L. Corbat,Chairman &  Chief Executive Officer,Financials,Commercial Banks,25,New York,NY,40.7127753,-74.0059728,"Dear Fellow Shareholders:
2018 was a year of steady and meaningful progress for Citi toward the overarching goal we laid out at our Investor Day in 2017: to improve the returns we generate on shareholders’ capital through 2020 and beyond. On that day we also outlined our strategy to meet that commitment. We would drive sustainable client-led revenue growth by deepening our relationships with current clients and capturing new ones in target segments. We would use our scale and technology to enhance our capabilities while lowering our cost to serve clients. We would optimize our capital base including returning all capital above what we need to prudently operate and invest in the firm. Finally we would continue to focus on our controls and risk management to ensure Citi is an indisputably strong and stable institution.
In 2018 we did each of those things while demonstrating our ability to navigate a complex environment which swung from a start marked by positive sentiment driven by U.S. tax reform and synchronized global growth to a close when markets declined with a volatility and velocity rarely seen. After a fourth quarter marked by concerns about the business cycle trade with China and the impact of Federal Reserve interest rate policy our continued progress in 2018 provided welcome assurance that our people model and global franchise are resilient in challenging markets.

Across our firm we drove growth as we said we would do by deepening relationships with current clients while also attracting new ones.

In our Global Consumer Bank we used our scale and technology to make it easier for our clients to seamlessly bank with us through their channel of choice. In our U.S. franchise our enhanced mobile app now gives clients a comprehensive view of their finances and in an industry first gives non-Citi clients those same capabilities. In Mexico our redesigned mobile app is driving double-digit user growth. We are leveraging our experience in Asia where we have high digital engagement and a growing digital lending platform.

In our Institutional Clients Group we upgraded our capabilities to focus fully on providing clients with solutions not products. Our Treasury and Trade Solutions business offers the industry’s most versatile and powerful suite of digital platforms tools and analytics. A prime example is the launch of Citi Smart Match® created in partnership with fintech firm HighRadius which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable our corporate clients to automate the matching of open invoices to payments.

But we’re not stopping there. Across Citi we’re continuously innovating to enhance our value proposition and accelerate our speed to market. We’re streamlining client onboarding providing more personalized offers creating more intuitive and convenient self-service platforms and taking pain points out of our processes. These actions lowered our cost to serve clients and enabled us to fund investments in areas that position us for future growth. In the second half of 2018 efficiency savings outpaced our incremental investments by about 200 million an amount we expect to grow into the 500 million–600 million range in both 2019 and 2020.

We also made structural changes across the franchise to drive growth and boost returns.

In our largest Consumer market — the U.S. — we created a more effective client-centric structure that unifies the leadership and strategy of our Branded Card and Retail Banking businesses consistent with our consumer franchises in Asia and Mexico. Our franchise should not only attract new clients but also enable us to convert a larger proportion of our more than 28 million Branded Card clients into multi-relationship customers. As many of our current Card clients reside beyond our six-city retail branch footprint we believe we can broaden these relationships by providing unique and compelling value propositions combined with our industry-leading digital capabilities and nationwide ATM network.

In our Institutional Clients Group we also made structural changes to further enhance our clients’ experience. By combining our Corporate Investment Banking and Capital-Markets Origination divisions into a new unit Banking Capital Markets and Advisory we’re providing clients with access to a broader range of creative solutions across our institutional platform. We’re also seeing the fruits of greater connectivity between our Treasury and Trade Solutions and foreign exchange businesses. Above all we’re giving ourselves an opportunity to take a broader deeper more holistic view of our clients and their evolving needs.

All of those actions supported our strategy and contributed to our business performance in 2018. The 18 billion of net income we earned was 14% higher than in 2017 excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform in both periods.1 On the same basis our earnings per share increased 25% to 6.65 per share driven by higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases. And we continued to make progress on our efficiency ratio driving it down to approximately 57% for the year after lowering our expense base to just under 42 billion.

Perhaps most significantly our Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) increased to 10.9%2 surpassing our target of at least 10.5% for the year as we work toward our goal of at least 13.5% for 2020.

Our performance on the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test approved us to return 22 billion of capital for the 2018 cycle and we are on track to meet our goal subject to regulatory approval of returning at least 60 billion of capital through the three CCAR cycles ending in 2020.

In the Global Consumer Bank and the Institutional Clients Group we generated underlying revenue growth of 3% excluding the impact of gains on sale in both periods.3 In our Global Consumer Bank we realized the benefits of investments we made over the past several years in areas of growth including U.S. Branded Cards; Retail Services aided by the acquisition of the L.L.Bean portfolio; and Mexico where we’re gaining market share and accelerating our digital transformation. In Asia we saw healthy inflows of assets under management and good growth in the number of Citigold clients despite the uncertain macro environment that impacted investment revenues.

Pay Equity Review
Pay Equity Review

Raw Pay Gap Data
Raw Pay Gap Data

In the Institutional Clients Group volatility and uncertainty at the end of the year adversely impacted our market-sensitive businesses including Fixed Income and Investment Banking although we grew share and revenues in M&A Advisory and Equities for the year. Our steady accrual businesses — Treasury and Trade Solutions Securities Services the Private Bank and Corporate Lending — grew revenues by 9% for the year. Our backbone Treasury and Trade Solutions business distinguished itself by growing revenues for the fifth consecutive year in constant dollars. And despite concerns about trade rhetoric and tariffs our global network — one that is hard to see replicated in the current environment — showed it is well-positioned to capture flows no matter where they shift.

Our bankers also served clients with distinction advising on some of the biggest deals of the year. A sampling includes NEX Group’s merger with CME Group advising Time Warner on its acquisition by AT&T serving as joint financial advisor to Ant Financial on the largest capital raise by a private company and Nestlé Holdings on its first U.S. dollar private placement.

The trust satisfaction and loyalty we’re building with Citi clients are also words that come to mind when I think about my Citi colleagues worldwide. They express how I feel about a number of close colleagues and friends of the firm who chose 2018 either to retire or embark on an exciting new phase of their life. I won’t name them all but I will note the important transition we announced in the fall when after nearly seven years as Chairman and a decade on our Board of Directors Michael O’Neill retired. We are enormously grateful to Michael O’Neill for making Citi’s Board and our firm stronger better more diverse and more capable.

The Board elected John C. Dugan as the next Chair. In doing so we maintained our model of having a Non-Executive Chair which is in keeping with leading corporate governance practices. John is a former Comptroller of the Currency distinguished counselor and longtime industry leader. Having been a Board member since 2017 and an advisor to the Board before that he knows our firm well and has hit the ground running.

Franz Humer and Anthony Santomero will also retire in 2019 having reached the retirement age for Citi Directors. Tony has been on the Board since 2009 and chaired the Citibank Board and the Risk Management Committee. Franz has been on the Board since 2012 and chaired the Ethics and Culture Committee. We thank both of them for their years of service.

We also thank and congratulate several senior members of my management team on their retirement including our Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach who is being succeeded by longtime Citi executive Mark Mason. Each of these talented executives will be missed yet we’re excited to welcome a new group of executives into leadership positions at Citi where I am sure they will shine.

In 2018 we also decided on a number of occasions that there are times when a company must take a stand. One of those times came in January when in keeping with our commitment to diversity and inclusion we were the first financial services firm to voluntarily disclose our adjusted pay gap between women and men in the U.S. the U.K. and Germany and between minorities and non-minorities in the U.S. We found that women were paid on average 99% of what men were paid and minorities were paid on average 99% of what nonminorities were paid and we made pay adjustments to help close the gaps. We viewed this as a first step on the road toward greater pay equity transparency.

In February I signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion joining more than 350 CEOs and presidents committed to driving policy changes and practices in our own firms that advance equitable workplaces. Over the summer my management team and I announced representation goals aimed at increasing the number of black colleagues in the U.S. and female colleagues globally in senior positions at our firm.

At the end of the day what matters most to me is that every Citi colleague feels pride in who they are and that Citi stands with them. In my experience having a diverse team of people around the table with different thoughts insights and perspectives leads to better decisions.

In March in the wake of the tragic school shooting in Parkland Florida and the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. we were the first bank to announce a Commercial Firearms Policy. It requires our retail sector clients to use established best practices including background checks and age restrictions. We’re under no illusion that any policy is a perfect solution but we — and I — couldn’t feel more strongly that it’s up to companies like ours to do more when we can.

Throughout the year our colleagues demonstrated their commitment to the communities we serve. In June we brought more than 100000 Citi volunteers alumni clients friends and families in over 450 cities in 90 countries and territories to work on more than 1400 service projects in their communities. It was our largest Global Community Day ever. From feeding hungry people to revitalizing schools our people showed the positive impact our company makes in the communities we serve.

The hard work of thousands of Citi colleagues has created a culture of which we can be proud. It’s a culture based on a foundation of ethics and execution informed by our mission of enabling growth and economic progress around the world.

These efforts are among the reasons Euromoney named Citi “Best Bank for Corporate Social Responsibility.” I couldn’t have said it better myself than the editors did: “The focus on improving economies for everyone is something that runs deep at Citi.”

That focus is reflected in our Sustainable Progress initiative under which we recorded 95 billion of transactions toward our 10-year 100 billion environmental finance goal. It is a goal we are going to reach almost five years ahead of schedule.

Citi Announced a Global Mission-Led Partnership with the International Paralympic Committee
“Citi and the IPC are ideal partners because we share a deep passion for helping to foster a more diverse and inclusive society. These athletes have overcome adversity to achieve the world’s most elite level of sporting excellence. Their strength perseverance and determination is truly what makes them exceptional and we look forward to supporting their journey to compete on the global stage.”
— CEO Michael Corbat
The 18 National Paralympic Committees Citi
The 18 National Paralympic Committees Citi will sponsor include Australia Chinese Taipei Colombia Costa Rica Great Britain Hong Kong India Indonesia Ireland Malaysia Mexico Nigeria Philippines Poland Singapore South Africa Thailand and the UAE.

The international partnership will run through 2020 and includes support for National Paralympic Committees in 18 countries as they prepare for upcoming World and regional Championships as well as the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games. Through the partnership Citi aims to raise awareness for the Paralympic Movement support Para athletes and advocate for societal change in perceptions around disability.
That focus also informed the Citi Foundation’s partnership with the International Rescue Committee to invest in training and placement for young refugees in Nigeria Jordan and Greece. That partnership is part of our 100 million commitment through Pathways to Progress to help 500000 young people globally to access economic opportunity through the workforce.

We entered 2019 with determination and focus. We have articulated our goals and have the resources to meet them. While the macroeconomic picture requires flexibility we are prepared for a range of operating environments.

We will remain true to our mission of enabling growth and progress and will continue to be true to our values as we serve our clients. As we have shown in 2018 our targets are achievable and we are committed to continuing to make steady progress toward them every day throughout 2019.

2018 was a year of differentiated execution for Marathon Oil. While many in our industry talked about capital discipline we delivered.

We budgeted conservatively in 2018 and never wavered. We drove significant improvement to our corporate returns and cash flow per debt adjusted share. Our teams meaningfully beat our initial oil production growth guidance through impressive capital efficiency gains across our portfolio and achieved remarkable success in organically improving the quality of our inventory base through core extension efforts especially in the Eagle Ford and Bakken.

Through improving capital efficiency we delivered more oil growth generated 865 million of organic free cash flow post-dividend and returned most of that cash back to you our shareholders via share repurchases. Over 25% of our 2018 net operating cash flow was returned to shareholders through the combination of our dividend and repurchases.

We know investors today are looking for companies that have the right portfolio of assets and the right strategy: putting returns first generating sustainable free cash flow at conservative oil prices and sharing that cash flow with investors. You want to see companies that maintain a strong balance sheet to weather potential volatility and companies that have the capability to execute on their commitments consistently. Our company priorities not only align with these criteria but our performance in 2018 stands as our proof point.

As we turn to 2019 and beyond Marathon Oil remains committed to this same framework for success. With the foundation of a peer leading balance sheet and the competitive advantages of our multi-basin portfolio our 2019 capital program will drive improving corporate returns and generate organic free cash flow above 45 WTI post dividend. Importantly while our 2019 free cash flow is robust across a broad range of commodity prices we believe our outlook only improves into 2020.

We would like to thank all of our dedicated employees and contractors who made 2018 a year of such differentiated execution for our company. Our future has never been brighter since becoming an independent E&P.

The history of Comcast has been shaped by a passion for innovation and growth consistent operational and financial success and a series of pivotal long-term value creating transactions. We bought AT&T Broadband in 2002 more than doubling our size and NBCUniversal in 2011 adding exceptional media content. This past year marked another transformative moment with the acquisition of Sky which significantly strengthened our global footprint.

My father Ralph felt that as technology advanced it would create new opportunities to reach potential customers anywhere. He believed our next frontier should be international. But how? We would need to find a company that was a leader in its markets had meaningful growth potential and shared our culture of entrepreneurialism and integrity.

Fortunately for us Sky is the perfect fit combining a great direct-to-consumer business similar to Comcast Cable with world-class content creation like we have at NBCUniversal. More importantly we are all guided by the same core principles: to compete to win to continuously improve and deliver the best products and experiences and to keep building deep relationships with customers.

So it is a pleasure to welcome Sky to Comcast NBCUniversal. Combined we now count 54 million direct customer relationships nearly 200 million homes in our footprint and nearly 200000 employees worldwide. With this kind of scale no one is better positioned to produce and distribute more content with better technology.

Even as we worked on this important transaction our operational leaders focused intensely on execution. As you will see in the following report our core businesses had a fantastic year and record success. At Comcast Cable we are innovating faster than ever. With the recent opening of the Comcast Technology Center in Philadelphia we have a sensational new home for more than 4000 engineers software architects and designers who are literally building the digital future and leading our industry. From our xFi platform – which is redefining what customers can expect from their broadband experience – to X1 to Mobile to Comcast Business to our pursuit of 10G speeds our products have never been more relevant or our customer satisfaction higher.

In the eight years that NBCUniversal has been part of Comcast it has had the fastest annual growth of any major media company. NBC was number one in overall viewership for the first time in 16 years and remains tops in the 18-49 category for the fifth straight year. Every one of our news programs was number one in its category. And we produced and delivered the trifecta of sports – the World Cup the Olympics and the Super Bowl – demonstrating the power of our big events strategy. Together with the performance of our cable networks filmed entertainment and theme parks every part of the business has thrived.

Beyond all of the terrific technology and content we have under our roof it is our employees who are our most important asset. We are so fortunate to attract and keep people who are proud of their company and devoted to making it the best. I cannot thank them enough for their passion and commitment. In the end they are the real reason that Comcast has such great forward momentum.

I am honored and humbled to help lead this amazing organization.

President and Chief Executive Officer 

Dear Fellow Shareholders
As your Board of Directors we take our responsibilities very seriously and are committed to representing your
interests in the long-term. We believe our shareholders are best served when the Company achieves
sustainable results in a responsible manner. We are pleased with the Company’s performance and are happy
to share specific actions that the Board has taken in the past year.
Purpose & Culture. The Board worked collaboratively with Gail Boudreaux in 2018 her first full year as
President and CEO to update the Company’s mission vision and values. As part of our strategic oversight we
ensure that the Company’s mission of improving lives and communities and simplifying healthcare is embedded
in the Company’s strategy and business plans. We have a special meeting each year dedicated to strategic
oversight as well as regular strategy discussions throughout the year.
The Board considers itself the guardian of the Company’s culture and recognizes the importance of culture in
achieving long-term success. We are proud that the Company was recognized in 2018 as one of the World’s
Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere.
Board Skills Diversity & Refreshment. Board succession planning is also essential to the Company’s
success. As Chair I have the privilege to work with a highly qualified and diverse group of board colleagues
who bring thought leadership perspective and accountability to their roles in overseeing the talented executive
team at Anthem. Your Board is highly diverse in terms of background expertise ethnicity and gender including
four women directors and four directors from diverse ethnicities. Diverse directors hold the key leadership
positions of Chair of the Board Chair of the Audit Committee Chair of the Governance Committee and
President and CEO.
Refreshing your Board with new perspectives and ideas is critical to ensuring that it remains strategic inclusive
and forward-looking. Each year we conduct a rigorous evaluation process including board and individual
director evaluations facilitated by an external party. Over the past couple of years three new directors have
joined the Board and two directors have retired. In addition George Schaefer will be retiring at the Annual
Meeting. The Board would like to recognize George for his significant contributions to the Company’s success
and his exemplary service to the Board in many roles over the years including Independent Chair of the Board
Lead Director and Chair of the Audit Committee.
Environmental Social & Governance (ES&G). We believe our ES&G practices promote the long-term
interests of our shareholders and strengthen Board and management accountability. The Board’s Governance
Committee is responsible for establishing the Company’s corporate governance practices as well as monitoring
the Company’s social responsibility and environmental sustainability initiatives. As part of the Committee’s
ongoing review of our corporate governance practices the Company’s governing documents were amended
last year to give shareholders the right to call a special meeting. We are proud that the Company was named
to the 2018 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America in recognition of our ES&G practices.
On behalf of the Board thank you for investing in Anthem. We hope to see you at the Annual Meeting.

You have undoubtedly read many stories about our efforts to take Dell private. I wanted you to hear directly from me.

I believe that taking Dell private is the right thing to do for the company. We need to transform and we need to do it quickly. The transformation is not without risks and challenges and I believe that we can do what we need to do better as a private company than a public company. 

When I came to the Dell board last August to ask if the board would consider the possibility of a going private transaction I understood that the independent directors would control the process and I made clear that I was ready to partner with whoever would pay the highest price. I encouraged every interested party to pay the highest price they could.

After one of the most thorough processes in history the highest price that any of the parties was willing to pay was 13.65 per share. Although no other party has offered to pay more than 13.65 per share Silver Lake and I have now increased our offer to 13.75 per share an increase to public shareholders of approximately 150 million which is our best and final offer.

I believe this offer is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders. Certain other parties have been proposing alternatives such as leveraged recapitalizations sales of assets and other steps that I believe would be destructive to the company and that I do not and will not support.

The decision is now yours. I am at peace either way and I will honor your decision. Our agreement requires the vote of a majority of the unaffiliated shares -- your shares -- to approve the transaction. Unfortunately our agreement also provides that shares that do not vote count as votes against the transaction. Currently over 25% of the unaffiliated shares have not voted. This means that even if a majority of the unaffiliated shares that vote on the transaction want to accept our offer the will of the majority may be defeated by the shares that do not vote. I think this is clearly unfair.

When we offered to increase our bid to 13.75 per share we also asked the Special Committee of the Board to change this unfair vote standard and allow the will of the majority of the unaffiliated shares that vote on the transaction to control the outcome. Particularly given the efforts of others to promote alternative transactions and the ability of those parties to vote their shares when my shares do not count it makes no sense whatsoever to skew the playing field even further by counting shares not voting as if they supported the opposition group. If the Special Committee agrees to our increased bid of 13.75 per share and agrees to create a fair and level playing field in which you can decide I will look forward to your decision.

Sincerely

Throughout my seven years in this role there have been many dramatic changes in global politics the world economy science technology and culture. At the same time there has also been an accelerated pace of progress in human health: unlocking the possibilities of the human genome evolving and expanding the use of robotics and micro surgery extending the life expectancy for people with HIV and continuing to wage and win the fight against cancer and other debilitating diseases that have resisted treatment for generations.

What’s most exciting about this progress is that Johnson & Johnson has been at the very forefront of many of these revolutionary changes and expanding horizons—time and time again delivering life-saving medicines and life-changing solutions.


133 Years of Innovative Credo-Driven Decisions That Have Made Johnson & Johnson the Healthcare Leader It Is Today
It is an honor to lead an innovation-driven culture that continues to demonstrate the energy drive and passion of a “start-up.” However we also have the distinct advantage of our timeless values such as the strong influence of our long-term strategic view the unwavering guidance of Our Credo and the profound way in which we measure progress and success. Our Credo challenges us to focus on improving outcomes for patients and consumers globally while we also focus on improving revenue and market share numbers. This philosophy allows us to lead with certainty even in the most challenging times to drive performance and purpose with equal commitment and enables us to maintain a leading role in defining the future of healthcare worldwide.


It is an honor to lead an innovation-driven culture that continues to demonstrate the energy drive and passion of a “start-up.”


In this letter I share the highlights of our performance our notable achievements and our aspirations for the years to come. My goal is to provide an aerial view of Johnson & Johnson today—a Company that spans six continents and 60 countries develops numerous innovative products and services and touches the lives of people all around the world every day.

Most importantly I want to emphasize my confidence in our expansive capabilities express my realistic optimism about our opportunities and challenges and offer my insights on how we will continue to shape the future of healthcare today.

Celebrating Our Credo 
In 2018 we celebrated the 75th anniversary of Our Credo. Written and introduced in 1943 by General Robert Wood Johnson Our Credo has been the blueprint for shaping the role that Johnson & Johnson plays in society.

Although Our Credo is literally etched in stone it is a living document that on a very few select occasions we have evolved to keep pace with the world in which we live.

Johnson & Johnson Chairman and CEO Alex Gorsky addressing employees about Our Credo’s 75th anniversary
The Power of Our Credo: Johnson & Johnson Chairman and CEO Alex Gorsky Reflects on the Legacy of the Company's Historic Mission Statement
In fact late last year we did exactly this by introducing some enhancements to Our Credo responsibilities that were inspired by feedback from more than 2000 of our diverse Johnson & Johnson employees representing all regions segments and functions.

These enhancements: 

Explicitly put the patient first and at the center of our focus;
Reflect the needs of a changing world and a new generation of employees;
Underscore our commitment to diversity and inclusion; and
Solidify our commitment to improving the health of humanity.
Our Credo remains as relevant today as when it was first introduced 75 years ago and I’m confident that it will propel Johnson & Johnson forward for the next 75 years and beyond.

Innovation is Our Calling Card 
When we hear the term “start-up” we think of an organization with high energy and creativity one that values agility and has a bold vision to change the world. As I look at the technologies we are investing in the companies we are partnering with and the people who come to work for us every day I believe those start-up attributes define our Company too—driving a vision of change that will have long-lasting impact for people everywhere.


Sustaining our investment in innovation is central to our ability to create meaningful change and competitive differentiation.


However the timeless values that support these strategies also make us different from the typical start-up. Our 133 years of success and achievement motivate us even more to bring new ideas and approaches to market today and well into the future.

The diversity of our organization which comprises a wide array of backgrounds capabilities experiences opinions and approaches enriches our collaborative innovation process. And this collaboration reaches far beyond the walls of Johnson & Johnson. For instance we are partnering with some of the world’s most respected universities research institutions technology giants and traditional start-ups as we support those who explore new fields of research in JLABS our Johnson & Johnson Innovation incubators.


How Johnson & Johnson Is Pioneering in the Fight Against the World's #1 Cancer Killer
A key example is how we are harnessing the strength of all three of our business segments in collaboration with Boston University research scientists to identify ways to better detect and treat the entire cycle of lung cancer. This disease is the leading cause of cancer mortality around the globe—we recognize the need and urgency and we are responding to this call to action with this exciting partnership.

Powerful innovation has also been made possible by the financial strength we’ve built over the decades. Sustaining our investment in innovation is central to our ability to create meaningful change and competitive differentiation. In 2018 we achieved a record-level of Research and Development (R&D) investment of approximately 10.8 billion. In fact across all industries we are one of the top 10 companies that invested at the highest levels in innovation and R&D.

Last year the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies invested in a number of value-creating acquisitions and collaborations which included Zarbee’s Inc. a leader in naturally based over-the-counter (OTC) remedies Orthotaxy a developer of software-enabled orthopaedic surgery technologies and Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. where we are working to bring a functional cure to patients with chronic hepatitis B. In total we executed 12 acquisitions and licenses of various sizes including our acquisition of the company that markets the DR CI LABO line of skincare products which officially closed in 2019. Additionally we signed 74 innovation deals as well as 29 new development deals and we continue to make investments across all industries through Johnson & Johnson Innovation-JJDC Inc. (JJDC).


New Year New Vision: Meet a Man Tasked With Investing in What Could Be the World's Next Great Medical Discoveries
As I just mentioned we continue to innovate in surgery. Over 100 years ago we were the pioneers of sterile surgery establishing an incredible heritage that today includes our leadership in minimally invasive surgery and innovatively controlling surgical bleeding and infection globally. Our goal and commitment is to now create the next frontier of surgery. That’s why I’m excited that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Auris Health Inc. Auris Health is a developer of robotic technologies that currently focuses on lung cancer. This acquisition will accelerate our entry into digitally enabled robotics procedures with the potential for growth and expansion into other interventional applications. In this new era of healthcare we are aiming to simplify surgery drive efficiency reduce complications improve outcomes for patients and make surgery even safer. This continues our surgical leadership that has been in motion since the beginning of our Company.

Looking ahead I am also very excited about our collaboration with Apple Inc. that we announced early in 2019. Together we will be conducting a research study that analyzes whether a new heart health program using an app from the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies in combination with Apple Watch’s irregular rhythm notifications and Electro Cardiogram (ECG) app can accelerate atrial fibrillation (AFib) diagnosis and improve health outcomes including the prevention of stroke for the 33 million people worldwide living with AFib. This is a condition that can lead to stroke and other potentially devastating complications. In fact in the U.S. alone AFib is responsible for approximately 130000 deaths and 750000 hospitalizations every year.


Want to Keep Your Heart Healthy? Listen to What This Cardiothoracic Surgeon Has to Say
We are very optimistic about the potential of this wearable technology. And based on the insights generated through this research program in the future we may also be able to develop new ways to detect other health conditions sooner. Early diagnosis not only has the potential to save lives but it may also lower costs across the healthcare system.

Innovation is our calling card to the world of science and technology. We remain open to the best ideas no matter where they come from as we relentlessly pursue transformational innovation to benefit human health internally and throughout our innovation ecosystem across our Innovation Centers JLABS JJDC and many strategic partnerships.

Driving Long-term Shareholder Value 
Our free cash flow* for 2018 improved to 18.5 billion and employing our proven capital allocation strategy we are able to effectively invest in our business and innovation to drive growth for long-term value while also returning value to shareholders. Our capital allocation strategy includes four key priorities:

Our first priority is to fund our internal growth opportunities via R&D and SM&A (selling marketing and administrative) initiatives.
The next priority is to deliver a competitive dividend to our shareholders and in 2018 we paid 9.5 billion in dividends. We are very proud that our dividend has increased for the last 56 consecutive years.
Once we’ve met our dividend goals we target mergers acquisitions and licensing agreements that we believe will add significant long-term value creation for our shareholders and all other stakeholders.
And finally we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as share repurchase programs; and we are currently executing against a 5 billion share repurchase that we announced last December.
Given our financial strength we can pursue all of these priorities simultaneously as we did in 2018. Throughout Johnson & Johnson’s history we have maintained a strong consistent and sustainable business. This is illustrated by:

35 consecutive years of adjusted operational earnings growth*
Being one of only two companies that hold a Triple A credit rating; and
Our standing among Standard & Poor’s Top 10 Market Cap companies.
The Strategic Advantage of Our Broad Base 
Positioned across three vital aspects of healthcare—Pharmaceutical Consumer and Medical Devices—we have unique insight into challenges and opportunities whenever and wherever they emerge. We are structured to meet the current and future needs of patients and consumers globally and to address the challenges and opportunities that the world of healthcare presents. We remain focused on leveraging our broad-based capabilities to continue to drive the next generation of growth across our entire portfolio both in markets where we have greater opportunity to compete as well as in the markets where we lead which include our 26 platforms that each delivered a billion dollars or more in sales last year.

Our broad base is not just our heritage it is a strategic choice grounded and proven in long-term performance and our broad and deep understanding of the industry’s present and future. We clearly recognize the important role we play in leading responsibly and representing our industry with integrity.

Our “Health for Humanity Report” underscores our commitment to help ensure that each new generation is healthier than the last. We believe our broad base helps us better understand and positively impact human health at every age and at every stage. In 2018 we were recognized as one of the top ten corporations for our environmental social and governance performance by Corporate Responsibility Magazine.


Our broad base is not just our heritage it is a strategic choice grounded and proven in long-term performance and our broad and deep understanding of the industry’s present and future.


Collaboration is fundamental to the work we do every day and our presence in just about every area of healthcare. This level of engagement allows us to maintain a continuous dialogue with healthcare professionals business leaders academics government officials scientists provider systems customers patients and consumers. We remain committed to being a leader in the global healthcare space to help drive the change that people around the world want and need to see.

We see a vital and vibrant future for healthcare around the world that is being driven by the continuing expansion of the global middle class. It is the middle class that drives global economic growth and with it the demand for greater access to quality healthcare. I believe that no company on Earth is better positioned than Johnson & Johnson to capture this opportunity and lead the healthcare industry.

Business Performance and 2019 Outlook

Pharmaceutical 
With an industry-leading pipeline and established commercial excellence our Pharmaceutical business has delivered outstanding performance for the past several years. Successful launches and strong growth in several of our blockbuster medicines created 11.8% operational growth* and our Pharmaceutical business continues to be an industry leader in all performance measures including R&D.

As we look toward 2019 and beyond we remain focused on bringing innovative solutions to patients and healthcare providers globally while driving strong growth and continuing to advance our pipeline. Patent pressure is a feature of today’s pharmaceutical industry and we have deliberately and actively managed our portfolio over the last few years to enable us to make the investments necessary to not only withstand this impact but to grow at competitive rates in 2019. We remain focused on developing medicines and solutions that deliver great value to the patients and consumers who depend on our products to make their lives better. Our goal and expectation for 2020 and beyond is sustained long-term above-market growth.

""I Have Treatment-Resistant Depression"": What It's Like to Live With the Challenging Mental Illness
We know that innovation drives our Pharmaceutical business’s success and we are very excited about the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of SPRAVATO™ (esketamine) CIII Nasal Spray for adults with Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) who have cycled through multiple treatments without relief. TRD is a debilitating disease that is associated with chronic health problems and quite tragically can lead to suicide if not treated properly. SPRAVATO™ represents not only a new breakthrough medicine in our product portfolio but also a new hope for adults who suffer from TRD. It also offers the first new mechanism of action to address TRD. And importantly in accordance with risk mitigation guidance from the FDA SPRAVATO™ can only be administered by certified treatment centers and will not be dispensed directly to patients to take at home.

We have listened with great intent to the concerns voiced by many stakeholders over the pricing and transparency of products and our healthcare systems in the United States and around the world. We are committed to taking the lead being responsible partners and doing our part to not only treat patients but also ensure they can get access in an open and affordable manner.

As a result of direct interaction with patients their families and healthcare professionals across the United States and building upon the original proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services we voluntarily took an important measure to help consumers gain a better picture of what they should expect to pay for their medicines. We have proposed including list-price information in direct-to-consumer TV ads starting with our most-prescribed medicine XARELTO (rivaroxaban) an oral anti-coagulant. To ensure patients have clarity we plan to include both the list price and potential patient out-of-pocket costs. We believe transparency is a fundamental responsibility of this Company. It’s also another strong demonstration that our purpose focused on helping patients is driving our business—just as it should be.


3 Things to Know About Johnson & Johnson's Appearance at the U.S. Senate Finance Committee Hearing on Drug Pricing
Our Pharmaceutical business has taken a strong leadership stance on increasing transparency in the industry. I am pleased to share we will release our third annual Janssen U.S. Transparency Report in late March. This report reflective of our actions in 2018 shows that our net prices have decreased again by 6.8%.

Consumer 
In 2018 fueled by our iconic brands and deep consumer insights our Consumer business achieved above-market growth. As we look ahead we will work to enhance our leadership in priority categories by focusing on critical geographies and our mega-brands while also continuing to expand into the fast-growing naturals category. Our acquisition of Zarbee’s Inc. in OTC is a key example of this expanding focus.

We have the strategies in place to move with the agility required to address evolving market needs. We have adopted a multichannel approach from the big-box retailers to e-commerce channels to better serve our consumers.

The results of our continual connection with consumers can be seen in the global relaunch of our JOHNSON’s Baby line of products in 2018. We are committed to disclosing 100% of our fragrance ingredients above 100 parts per million (ppm) in our shampoos washes and lotions. And we’ve been recognized for this greater transparency by The Environmental Working Group. Our relaunch also includes new packaging and informational social media communications tailored to the needs and wants of millennial moms and dads. Our global JOHNSON’s Baby relaunch is off to a solid start and we will continue to launch across global markets throughout 2019.


3-D Printed Face Masks Personalized to Your Skin? The Future Is Here
Additionally in response to our consumers asking for personalized skincare solutions that address their skin’s unique needs we are developing our most personalized skincare product to date called the NEUTROGENA MaskiD. This 3D-printed sheet mask is inspired by user data and will deliver the clinical efficacy expected from the #1 dermatologist-recommended brand in the U.S. Our NEUTROGENA brand is already globally recognized for delivering topical skincare solutions at the intersection of science and technology. This new product will represent one further step toward a new model of product development where we find creative uses for the latest technology such as digital imaging skin analysis and 3D printing to give consumers new ways to achieve their best skincare possible. It is also a great example of how we are leveraging innovation across our business segments as our 3D printing capability originated within Medical Devices.

Medical Devices 
Our Medical Devices businesses are among the most diverse and successful in the healthcare industry. At the same time we fully recognize that our progress has not been uniform across the Medical Devices portfolio. We have many areas of particularly strong performance such as Electrophysiology Vision Care Wound Closure and Bio-Surgery. However there are also areas where we must improve specifically within Orthopaedics. We demonstrated progress throughout 2018 with the performance of our knee and spine businesses and we believe this positions us well for 2019 and beyond.

In 2018 we improved operational growth excluding acquisitions and divestitures by 1.1%* as compared to 2017. Additionally we improved our cadence of innovation by delivering 21 major product launches in 2018.

One example is the launch of the EMBOTRAP II Revascularization Device a next-generation stent retriever used to capture and remove life-threatening blood clots from the brain following an ischemic stroke. We received FDA clearance to market the mechanical clot removal or thrombectomy device last May.


Acuvue Oasys® With Transitions™ Light Intelligent Technology™ Contact Lenses Named One of Time's Best Inventions of 2018
In 2019 we plan to launch 20 to 25 major products including ACUVUE OASYS with Transitions™ Light Intelligent Technology™ a first-of-its-kind contact lens that was named one of TIME Magazine’s Best Inventions of 2018. Another example is the ECHELON CIRCULAR Powered Stapler a next generation technology to reduce complications in colorectal gastric and thoracic cancer surgeries. Clearly advancing our strategy in digital surgery is a major investment for our future. Our digital surgery platform is being designed to combine robotics advanced instrumentation and data analytics to enable better patient outcomes by improving access to minimally invasive surgery and helping to reduce the cost of care.

As we capitalize on our comprehensive portfolio and an accelerated growth strategy we are committed to improving performance across our Medical Devices business.

While we are pleased with our 2018 performance we are never satisfied. Looking ahead we are committed to advancing the innovation pipeline in our Pharmaceutical business broadening the reach of our Consumer business and meeting the full potential of our Medical Devices business.


I want to emphasize that product quality and safety are not only top business priorities for Johnson & Johnson they are also core obligations embodied in Our Credo.


Leading With Certainty 
The volume and speed of change around the world and across all business industries is the new normal. The velocity of this change is apparent with circumstances like the evolving geopolitical landscape ongoing market volatility rising pressure to reduce pricing rapid entry of disruptive technologies a crowded competitive marketplace and an expanding range of customer preferences to name just a few. And litigation unfortunately is prevalent throughout the healthcare industry.

These kinds of external factors can impact any business’s brand reputation and business model so in partnership with our Board of Directors executive committee and leadership teams across the Company we look to mitigate these kinds of external risk factors wherever possible.

Additionally I want to emphasize that product quality and safety are not only top business priorities for Johnson & Johnson they are also core obligations embodied in Our Credo. Across every Johnson & Johnson business we apply a scientific evidence-based approach in decisions about the research marketing and use of our products. Many of our brands and products have been trusted by consumers for decades and when the safety of our products is challenged we will continue to defend them. We have a legacy of working hard to earn our customers’ trust and working equally hard to keep it—this commitment will always remain intact.

We are confident in our ability to lead with certainty and to responsibly navigate our way through these potential challenges. And because we are committed to thriving in this change environment our goal is not merely to adapt to change but to be the catalyst for needed change. We also lead with certainty because we are in the business of caring for the world all day every day. Guided by Our Credo we have a solid financial foundation a strong strategic framework an innovation mindset a performance driven culture and a very bright future focused on advancing the health and well-being of all our stakeholders—today and for generations to come.

Our People Passion and Purpose 
I’ve often noted healthcare is an industry that attracts very special people. While they want the opportunity to build a meaningful career they also want to be a part of something truly significant that makes an important difference in people’s lives. Fortunately we have the very best of these special people at the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies. And I believe our culture of diversity and inclusion brings out the best that our Johnson & Johnson colleagues have to offer.

Our goal is to lead by example by cultivating the world’s healthiest most productive and most engaged workforce. I believe this is critical for operating a healthy and successful business. And this is how we will deliver and ensure that another 133 years of quality healthcare is within reach of everyone everywhere.

An Education in Human Health 
I am as excited and encouraged today as I was on the day I started as CEO of this Company and accepted the responsibilities that come with it.

Throughout my career at Johnson & Johnson I have been very fortunate to learn this business from the perspective of a company that is built on the belief in the transformative possibilities of human ingenuity and personal caring. The world has been the campus for my education in human health as it has been for my Johnson & Johnson colleagues. I deeply appreciate the guiding support of our highly accomplished Board of Directors and continue to be proud and humbled as I work side by side with this team of impressive executive leaders whose partnership and expertise motivate me and all our Johnson & Johnson colleagues every day in our shared commitment to advance health for humanity.


We have approximately 135000 global employees united by a shared commitment and a common purpose that aspires to create a world without disease and with greater access to quality healthcare.


My optimism for the future is inspired by the rapid and continuous improvements in the condition of human health and the increasing possibilities for healthcare in the world. Most importantly we have the amazing privilege of touching lives around the world every day—from babies taking their first breath to baby boomers taking a breath after doing the Johnson & Johnson Official 7 Minute Workout.

We also have the pleasure of serving patients and consumers everywhere on Earth—people who put their trust in our Johnson & Johnson brands. We never forget the responsibility that comes with this trust. And we never forget our essential partnership with our shareholders who support our mission and help us pursue a noble purpose. While the challenges are great the rewards are even greater. I can’t imagine a better or more fulfilling calling!

I offer my sincere thanks to all of you for this great privilege opportunity and experience.

2018 was a defining year for IBM and our clients. Your company returned to growth just as businesses readied to enter Chapter 2 of their digital reinventions.

For years we have focused on building the tools businesses need in the 21st century. Our investments have reshaped IBM to lead in the emerging high-value segments of the IT market including analytics artificial intelligence cloud security blockchain and quantum computing. At the same time we have deepened our longstanding commitment to the responsible stewardship of technology.

IBM is now ready to help our clients advance their business transformations.

In my letter to you this year I will describe IBM’s performance in 2018. I will outline how clients are poised to enter Chapter 2 of their digital reinventions with help from IBM and how this translates to growth for IBM for businesses and for the world.

2018: Return to Growth
In 2018 IBM achieved 79.6 billion in revenue and operating earnings per share of 13.81. For the full year we returned to revenue growth grew earnings per share and stabilized margins.

Our strategic and continued investment in innovative technology drove our improved competitive position and profit dynamics. Offerings that address data AI cloud analytics and cybersecurity now represent more than half of our revenue—up from a quarter just four years ago—accounting for approximately 40 billion in revenue in 2018.

Our investment of more than 5 billion in research and development produced thousands of breakthrough innovations which led to IBM’s 26th consecutive year of U.S. patent leadership. Of the 9100 patents granted to IBM in 2018 more than 1600 were related to AI and 1400 to cybersecurity—more than any other company in either area.

This focus on breakthrough innovation has created IBM’s strongest portfolio ever and has driven results:

Total cloud revenues were more than 19 billion in 2018 up 12 percent. In the fourth quarter alone IBM signed 16 client services agreements worth more than 100 million to help optimize business performance on the IBM Cloud. Today 47 of the Fortune 50 depend on the IBM Cloud.
IBM is the world’s enterprise AI leader. Solutions enabled by IBM Watson are helping produce better decision-making and business outcomes through more than 20000 client engagements across 20 industries to date. IDC ranked IBM number one in AI market share. We continue to pioneer innovations in natural language processing speech processing computer vision and machine learning.
IBM Blockchain is the global leader in improving trust and transparency across business networks by creating a new way for clients to share and secure data. IBM Blockchain now powers more than 500 client projects with more than 85 active networks transforming supply chains global shipping and cross-border finance.
IBM Security the world’s largest cybersecurity enterprise has 8000 subject matter experts serving more than 17000 clients in more than 130 countries. The industry’s leading AI and cloud-based security solutions include IBM Security Connect launched in 2018 which allows clients to gather integrate and analyze security data across multiple applications and tools in a vendor-agnostic way.
IBM Systems produces innovative infrastructure for AI and hybrid cloud. The z14 is one of IBM’s most successful mainframe programs in history with broad global adoption across 27 different industry segments. In addition the U.S. Department of Energy’s POWER9-based supercomputers Summit and Sierra were ranked the most powerful supercomputers in the world in 2018.
IBM Services was a key driver of IBM’s performance in 2018. Forty-seven engagements worth more than 100 million each helped major clients—like Bank of the Philippine Islands Juniper Networks Nordea Westpac and Aditya Birla Retail—move to the next stage of their digital transformations.

New IBM investments are further energizing our portfolio. In late 2018 we announced plans to acquire Red Hat the world’s leading open source technology provider for the enterprise. With this acquisition which is expected to close in the second half of 2019 IBM will enhance our position as the world’s number one hybrid cloud provider helping clients unlock the full business value of the cloud.

We also continued to divest stand-alone software and services assets that are no longer strategic for IBM.

At the same time we remained committed to returning capital to our shareholders. In 2018 we returned more than 10 billion to you our shareholders including dividends of 5.7 billion and gross share repurchases of 4.4 billion. We raised our dividend for the 23rd consecutive year—IBM’s 103rd straight year of providing one.

Moving Clients to the Next Chapter of Digital Reinvention
For the past several years businesses around the world have been driving their digital reinventions to take advantage of data their most powerful source of competitive advantage.

This first chapter has been defined largely by experimenting with narrow and disparate AI applications and moving simple workloads—typically consumer and customer-facing applications—to the cloud.

Now we are beginning to see the contours of Chapter 2 among pioneering businesses: moving from experimentation to true business transformation at scale with AI and hybrid cloud.

This next chapter of digital reinvention will be enterprise-driven. It will be characterized first by scaling AI and embedding it everywhere in business. Second in cloud it will be characterized by moving mission-critical applications to hybrid cloud—using a combination of multiple public clouds private clouds and on-premise IT capabilities so businesses can create the environment most suitable for their enterprise workloads. Underpinning it all is the growing importance of trust both in technologies and in their impact on the world.

Scaling AI throughout the Enterprise
In Chapter 2 of their digital reinventions businesses will begin to scale AI across the enterprise as some first movers are already demonstrating.

Take the world’s leading banks for example. While many have been applying AI to specific challenges some first movers are scaling AI across the enterprise. Orange Bank one of the fastest growing mobile banks in France now manages all customer service through IBM Watson. Similarly Banco Bradesco is now using IBM Watson to assist every member of its services team—resolving customer inquiries in seconds with nearly 95 percent accuracy.

IBM brought AI for business into the mainstream with the introduction of our Watson platform in 2014. Today IBM Watson is the most open and trusted AI for business available to run on any environment—on premise and in private and public clouds. Businesses can apply Watson to data wherever it is hosted and infuse AI into their applications regardless of where they reside.

With Watson Studio Watson Machine Learning and Watson OpenScale IBM delivers a suite of tools that allow enterprises to build deploy and manage their AI models in a hybrid cloud environment. IBM Watson OpenScale a first-of-a-kind platform introduced in 2018 also enables businesses to manage their AI—no matter where it was built or where it runs—with transparency explainability and bias mitigation. Addressing these factors which traditionally have held businesses back is critical for scaling AI throughout an enterprise.

Through IBM Services we are helping our clients around the world apply AI to core business processes and workflows infusing their businesses with automation intelligence and continuous learning to transform everything from supply chains and HR to finance and operations.

In 2018 we also launched a new service called IBM Talent and Transformation that addresses the often overlooked cultural aspects of AI. This service helps our clients ensure their teams have the right skills and talent—and the supporting culture and work environment—to support a new way of working that is critical to scaling AI for business.

Moving Mission-Critical Work to Hybrid Cloud
In the first chapter of digital reinvention cloud deployments largely focused on easily portable workloads for productivity and commodity computing. This primarily was driven by user-facing applications inspired by advances in consumer technology. As a result only 20 percent of enterprise workloads today have moved to the cloud.

The remaining 80 percent of enterprise workloads provides the real value opportunity for business—transforming mission-critical workloads and applications for the cloud. The challenge is that most businesses have unique regulatory or data requirements and anywhere from five to 15 clouds across multiple providers.

That is why businesses moving to Chapter 2 will need to embrace a new hybrid cloud approach. It is one that will allow them to more easily move data and scale AI and other applications across public private and on-premise IT in their enterprises with consistent management and security protocols using open source technology.

For example BNP Paribas a leading European bank is working with IBM to speed and scale the launch of new digital and AI customer services across the cloud while protecting the security and confidentiality of customer data. Similarly global telecom leader Vodafone Business is partnering with IBM to innovate the way it delivers multicloud and digital capabilities—including AI edge computing 5G and software-defined networking solutions—to its customers.

IBM Services provides end-to-end cloud integration capabilities and is helping thousands of businesses migrate integrate and manage applications and workloads seamlessly and securely across any cloud environment. Industry experts from IBM Services are co-creating cloud-enabled solutions with clients in our IBM Garages. Using design thinking and agile methods we are helping clients implement new ways of working such as rapid prototyping and iteration to more quickly move technology projects from pilot to production at scale.

We are ready for this moment of moving clients to Chapter 2 of their digital reinventions with our unique integration of innovative technology industry expertise and a reputation for trust and security earned over decades. IBM is now moving the world’s major enterprises to the next era an effort that will be enhanced by our planned acquisition of Red Hat.

“We are ready for this moment of moving clients to Chapter 2 of their digital reinventions with our unique integration of innovative technology industry expertise and a reputation for trust and security earned over decades.”

Chapter 2 of Trust and Responsible Stewardship
We recognize that our clients and the consumers they serve expect more than groundbreaking innovation and industry expertise. They want to work with technology partners they can trust to protect their data and handle it responsibly. They want to work with partners who know how to bring new technologies into the world safely and help society benefit from them. And they want their partners to create inclusive workplaces and communities where diversity thrives.

These expectations are linked by a common theme: responsibility. Responsibility has been a hallmark of IBM’s culture for 107 years—from our labs to our boardroom. IBMers’ unwavering global commitment to the responsible stewardship of data and powerful new technologies has earned us the trust of clients and society as a whole.

In 2018 as trust in technology came under heightened global scrutiny we published our IBM Principles for Trust and Transparency which have long guided our company. They stress our belief that the purpose of new technologies is to augment—not replace—human intelligence and that the data and insights derived from technology belong to the businesses who own them. The principles also emphasize that new technologies brought into the world must be open transparent explainable and free of bias.

We know that AI like other transformative technologies before it will have a profound impact on peoples’ jobs and the workplace. That is why in 2018 IBM further expanded access to the pathways through which students and professionals can build skills for today’s technology era. That includes “new collar” jobs where having the right skills matters more than having a specific degree. Through our work in 11 U.S. states and 13 countries there will be 200 Pathways in Technology Early College High Schools—or P-TECHs—serving a pipeline of 125000 students in the 2019 school year.

2018 also saw the rapid growth of our IBM Apprenticeship Program which trains people in 21st-century skills ranging from blockchain and digital design to cybersecurity—and which expanded nearly twice as fast as we had projected in its first year.

Yet skills are only part of today’s workforce opportunity. In 2018 fueled by record diverse hiring promotion and retention we achieved our greatest progress in a decade on diversity representation among global executive women and underrepresented minorities. We also continued advocating with governments around the world for policies that help ensure workplaces are as inclusive and diverse as the world we live in.

Recognizing that responsible stewardship should not be confined within IBM’s walls we also are working aggressively to empower others to do lasting good. We are for example a founding partner in Call for Code a global initiative that works with software developers to create solutions that can help save lives. Last year 100000 open source developers from 156 countries responded to the call creating more than 2500 applications to help communities recover from natural disasters.

As IBM sees it the promise of technology is to empower people to do good access new opportunities and make the world better safer and smarter—for the many not just the few.

IBM Poised to Lead
In summary we have returned your company to growth. We have positioned IBM’s products services and people to enable clients to write the next chapter of their digital reinventions. And we have done it all while reaffirming IBM’s longstanding reputation for trust integrity and responsibility.

Our work ahead is to build on this progress and bring these capabilities to life for our clients. I want to thank all of our clients for partnering with us while we reinvented IBM and for choosing us for their own journeys of transformation.

I also would like to thank our investors for their confidence in IBM. Finally I would like to thank the hundreds of thousands of IBMers whose expertise has prepared us to lead in this new chapter of digital reinvention.

I am honored to steward this great company and I am filled with optimism about what we can achieve in partnership with our clients and society. Together we are changing work and business—and ultimately the world.

Cornell,Chairman &  Chief Executive Officer,Retailing,General Merchandisers,25,Minneapolis,MN,44.977753,-93.2650108,"Two years ago we laid out an ambitious investment agenda to transform our company – by reimagining our stores reinventing our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities repositioning our owned brand portfolio and investing in our team. And as I look back on our performance in 2018 I could not be more proud of all that our team accomplished.

In 2018 comparable sales rose an industry-leading 5 percent driven entirely by growth in traffic. We gained market share in every major category. And we established a record high for our earnings per share.

Today I can say with great confidence that the strategy we laid out two years ago is working. Our guests love what they see. And in this intensely competitive landscape Target is right where we want to be: among the top performers in the industry.

But anyone who follows retail knows that we operate in an incredibly dynamic marketplace. So if we want to stay on top as a brand our guests love shop and admire we know we have more work to do. Rest assured our team understands that better than anyone. Our goal isn’t to deliver only incremental gains or to string together a couple of strong quarters. Our goal is to build a better company powered by a durable and defensible business model that delivers strong profitable growth for years to come.

As we look to the future that means you can expect Target to keep investing and growing.

Last year we said we wanted to become America’s easiest place to shop. And our team delivered as Target became the first retailer to offer same-day and Drive Up fulfillment capabilities coast-to-coast. In the year ahead we’ll continue to invest and expand our network focusing on elevating our service experience and driving greater adoption among our guests.

In the last two years we remodeled more than 400 stores and we’re on track to deliver 600 additional remodels by the end of 2020. And we’re still thoughtfully adding to our store footprint. In 2018 we opened more than two dozen small-format stores. This year we’re planning to add nearly 30 more – zeroing in on high-traffic urban locations and college campuses.

Last year we undertook an ambitious redesign of our stores-operating model – redefining thousands of roles to deliver better guest service. We raised our minimum wage for U.S. team members to 12 an hour. And we raised it again in early 2019 – to 13 – as we move toward our commitment to a minimum 15 an hour by the end of 2020.

Digital channels continue to play a key role in our overall sales growth. In 2018 comparable digital sales grew 36 percent capping the fifth-straight year in which our digital growth has topped 25 percent. Today Target’s digital performance is delivering more than 5 billion in annual sales – and driving additional growth across the business. In the year ahead you can expect that we’ll keep investing in digital capabilities – from artificial intelligence to virtual reality – that will elevate the shopping experience and give our guests new reasons to choose Target.

Finally when we introduced our investment agenda at the beginning of 2017 we said we’d deliver more than a dozen new brands in 18 months. As of today we’ve more than doubled that number and our team is still going strong. Recently Fast Company named Target one of the world’s most innovative companies specifically for our brand work. In 2019 Target will deliver a steady stream of newness and exclusives across our assortment as we continue to launch brands and introduce new partnerships.

Taken together we expect these initiatives will power a financial model that is designed to consistently generate low-single digit sales growth mid-single digit growth in operating income and high-single digit growth in earnings per share. This financial model is also designed to generate strong cash flow and return on invested capital that will not only sustain but fuel our performance in the years ahead.

So as we move into 2019 we aren’t slowing down our efforts to adapt create innovate and inspire. I want to thank our teams in stores and property management in merchandising in supply chain in marketing and communications; our product designers and sourcing experts; our data scientists digital and technology teams; our teams in finance strategy legal and HR – everyone across Target. This is the team that will continue serving our guests creating value for our shareholders and leading this industry for many years to come.

      	UPS is Strong
Today and
CREATING our
Tomorrow.	
  
 	 	 
It is my pleasure to invite you to join us at UPS’s 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. Since our last Annual Meeting UPS has continued our sweeping transformation that is touching every part of our business — from leadership and culture to our operations processes and the way we go to market.
In short UPS is Strong Today and CREATING our Tomorrow. We embarked on this transformation from a position of strength with a commitment to create our own future. UPS has a powerful brand an exceptional and essential global network and a broad product and solutions portfolio that is designed to meet the current and emerging needs of our customers. UPS produces strong cash flow the industry’s highest margins and a solid balance sheet.

Our transformation is designed to achieve three principal goals: generate high-quality revenue growth; drive efficiencies and cost reductions that will improve our margins; and further develop our talent as we continue to foster a culture of innovation.

The investments we are making in our network people technology and products will improve leverage in our global operations – and are creating greater differentiation for UPS in the markets we serve. Our customers will benefit from more flexibility consistency and visibility in how packages are moved through our network. By enhancing the value we create for our customers we will generate higher revenue per package better balance between our business and residential-based volumes and a higher level of earnings growth.

We made substantial progress on the network investment initiatives we first discussed in early 2017. We are implementing technology that is making our network and our company more efficient more flexible more resilient and more anticipatory. The result is a network that enables us to attract additional opportunities for high quality growth and generate improved operating margins.

We are capturing opportunities through digital technology and automation that are changing the way people and companies connect and communicate. Additionally our advanced methods of optimizing the flows of freight and packages with available capacity results in improved transit times for our customers and better asset utilization and network efficiency. To build on those improvements and fulfill the growing demand for our services we are significantly expanding capacity through comprehensive investments across our operations.

These improvements have succeeded in large part due to the innovative ideas and commitment to service our people bring to UPS everyday. We will continue to shape our culture so we can seize on the new market opportunities of the 21st century.

I want to encourage all of our shareowners to vote. This is your opportunity to share your views with the Company. We look for meaningful ways to engage with our investors as we continually seek to grow our business improve governance and increase shareowner value. We are grateful to those shareowners who have previously shared their views. As we approach the Annual Meeting I encourage you to contact us with any questions or feedback at 404-828-6059.

On behalf of the entire Board of Directors thank you for your continued support of UPS.

balance sheet. We are well positioned in a nearly 900 billion home
improvement sector that is large and growing but also very fragmented
representing a great opportunity to grow market share. Our 300000
associates are resilient and committed to serving our customers and
our communities. They are our greatest asset.
In 2018 we delivered solid results with total sales growth of 3.9 percent driven by
comparable sales growth of 2.4 percent. Diluted earnings per share were 2.84 while
adjusted diluted earnings per share1
 grew 16.4 percent to 5.11. We generated over
5.0 billion in free cash flow and through a combination of both dividends and share
repurchases we returned approximately 4.5 billion to our shareholders.
We believe we can deliver even stronger results going forward by focusing on retail
fundamentals. To maximize value for our shareholders and deliver an outstanding
experience for our customers we will stay true to our new mission statement: Together
deliver the right home improvement products with the best service and value across
every channel and community we serve. This mission statement defines what we will
stand for each and every day as a company.
Fiscal 2018 was a rebalancing year in which we took the necessary steps to begin building a sustainable foundation from which to drive long-term value creation. During the
year we realigned leadership to improve our focus execution and decision making.
We assembled a talented team with extensive retail and technical experience who will
facilitate the creation of a seamless omni-channel environment.
We also completed a strategic reassessment which included realigning our portfolio to
improve our focus and eliminate underperforming and non-core assets. And we rationalized store inventory in the U.S. and Canada to eliminate clutter and allow for investments
in job lot quantities for the Pro and an increased depth of high-velocity SKU’s.
We established a go-forward strategy focused on driving operational excellence and
better serving our customers. We will achieve this by winning in four key areas:
» Merchandising excellence;
» Supply chain transformation;
» Operational efficiency; and
» Customer engagement
We are committed to delivering merchandising excellence by ensuring we have the
right products in the right place at the right time. The implementation of a category
management process will prioritize resources and drive better sales productivity both
in-store and online. We are building out Merchandising Service Teams to help streamline our reset and in-store execution process. These teams will improve our speed to
market allowing us to roll out new products more quickly and drive market share gains
while also reducing disruption to our stores. We’ll also drive merchandising productivity through the rollout of our field merchandising teams who will focus on delivering
localized product assortments to better meet the needs of the customer at the market
level drive customer engagement and improve our sales per square foot.
Our supply chain transformation is focused on improving the omni-channel customer
experience by optimizing the network of assets in our distribution system as well as
the flow of product between those assets to drive topline growth and cost efficiencies.
We are optimizing order management fulfillment and delivery to ensure that we can
efficiently flow inventory with the required network and capacity to meet our customers’

needs. We are also standing up systems and processes such that by the end of 2019
we will have better visibility to product coming into the network as well as visibility to
product location as it moves through the network to improve our in-stock position.
We are also working to drive operational efficiency. By simplifying store operations we
can provide a better customer experience and unlock profits for the overall enterprise.
We are redesigning processes and systems to ensure better department coverage and
overall customer service while ensuring a more efficient use of payroll hours. We are
also working diligently to improve in-stock execution to better capitalize on the traffic
we are driving to our stores and Lowes.com.
Intensifying customer engagement is our fourth area of strategic focus. Pro customers
are at the core of this objective as they account for half of the U.S. home improvement
product market yet represent only 20–25 percent of our sales. To win with the Pro we
are focused on delivering consistent service levels by adding dedicated Pro Department
Supervisors and associates to help Pros load big bulky items. We’re also investing in
job lot quantities to ensure we have the right inventory depth at the store level to meet
Pro customer needs. To advance the overall customer experience we are improving
associate engagement and equipping our associates with the tools necessary to better
serve customers.
We are also creating a true expense reduction culture and implementing a more rigorous
process for capital approval to improve return on invested capital1
. We believe that our
targeted initiatives designed to drive profitable sales combined with an expense reduction culture will allow us to generate significant cash flow from operations. We are
committed to investing in the business while also returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And given our strong cash generation
capabilities and improving outlook for the Company in December 2018 our Board of
Directors authorized 10 billion in additional share repurchases.
The future for Lowe’s is bright. We have a great opportunity to capitalize on a healthy
home improvement sector and a tremendous brand by focusing on retail fundamentals
and simplifying our business. The expertise operational discipline and focus of this
leadership team will allow us to successfully execute on our strategies and capitalize
on the opportunity in front of us.
Lastly I would like to thank our employees for their dedication resilience and commitment to serving both customers and the communities in which they live and work.

We find ourselves today at a significant moment in the history of the technology industry and of Intel. We enter our second half-century as the world is reordering in ways that promise to make our company even more central to its future.

The fact that this year also marks my first as CEO leading this extraordinary team—and this annual report my first to you our owners—brings all of this home to me in a highly personal way. The opportunities and the responsibilities are frankly both humbling and energizing as I meet Intel employees partners and customers around the world.

When Intel was created in 1968 the world was witnessing an explosion of hardware capability. Propelled by Gordon Moore’s famous law Intel its partners and its customers transformed business and society by providing a run of innovation that rivaled the Industrial Revolution. At various points along the way some believed that semiconductors had become commodities. Always technology together with software innovation created new possibilities and opportunity that dwarfed everything that had come before it.

Today computing is distributed into all things now capable of entirely new and more powerful kinds of work—most notably machine learning deep learning and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI). We find ourselves again not at an end but at a beginning. The data-centric era is bringing volumes and varieties of information that make entirely new demands on our technology. A diversity of innovation will be required to make the leaps forward in performance efficiency latency security and form factors that create value for our customers across the spectrum of new workloads.

In response your company has been on a journey of transformation. One principally fueled by opportunity. This is visible in our financial performance. Exceeding the goals we set in January we achieved record revenue in 2018 up 13 percent due to strong demand in both our datacentric and PC-centric businesses. We grew operating income faster than revenue and earnings per share even faster. Improvements in operational efficiency contributed to these strong results while we also invested a record 28.7 billion in R&D and capital spending to strengthen our competitive position.

We continued improving the performance and capabilities of our industry-leading CPUs while expanding our efforts to win in growth areas like AI autonomous driving and 5G. We are developing new purpose-built processors and technologies enabling new classes of products for our customers. We can do this because Intel is uniquely able to invest billions of dollars across six pillars of innovation that will drive computing forward: process and packaging technology architectures memory interconnects security technologies and software. At the same time we are researching completely new approaches to computing like neuromorphic probabilistic and quantum that could unlock even greater opportunities. Today Intel is not only the CPU leader in PC and server segments but we are positioned to compete and hungry to win in a market for silicon that has expanded to more than 300 billion1 — the largest in our company’s history.

Finally because our work is inherently linked to the growth not only of business but of society innovation and economic impact must be accompanied by continued extension of our role as a global citizen and leader. The many dimensions of this are described in our Corporate Responsibility Report at www.intel.com/responsibility. I am especially proud of the outstanding diversity and inclusion accomplishment in which Intel reached full representation2 of women and underrepresented minorities in our U.S. workforce and gender pay equity across our global workforce. Also to celebrate our 50th anniversary Intel employees contributed 1.5 million volunteer hours around the world.

The path ahead while enormously promising remains challenging. As Andy Grove reminded us it helps to be paranoid and we take nothing for granted in driving our transformation forward.

Our ambitions have never been greater but with an expanded market comes new competition. In particular we have missed important milestones in process technology which weighed on our customers and created opportunity for our competitors. To win we must execute with excellence and at the same time approach every day with a growth mindset and a customer obsession. We must deeply internalize the essential role we play in our customers’ businesses and relentlessly anticipate their need for the scalable and highly-relevant innovation that only Intel can offer. Our data-centric strategy will continuously evolve and we rigorously evaluate opportunities to accelerate our transformation while optimizing return on our investments.

Our ace in the hole is our culture and our ability to evolve it. This company is unbelievable in its ability to solve problems. Challenges can tear teams apart—or bring them together. Our leadership team and our employees responded to the challenges and opportunities of 2018 by coming together to engineer solutions improve our execution and increase our output. I am confident that they will do so in 2019 and beyond.

That’s why I am so proud humbled and grateful to find myself writing to you for the first time as the current steward of this special company to thank you for your continued support and trust. I truly believe our second half-century promises to be even more remarkable than our first.

The year 2018 marked a turning point for MetLife. We closed the book on key
challenges and pivoted to the future.
Our long struggle to remain on a level playing field with competitors came
to a successful end when the federal government dropped its appeal of the
court victory rescinding our designation as a systemically important financial
institution (SIFI). We completed the final leg of the spin-off of our U.S. retail
business the centerpiece of our strategy to become less capital intensive and
interest-rate sensitive. And we created a new group within MetLife focused
on our performance as a sustainable company.
We are in the business of making and keeping promises. For more than
150 years MetLife has been there for people after life’s most destabilizing
moments and the management team feels a deep sense of responsibility to
our customers and their families. We are committed to running the company
responsibly and with a long-term perspective so that we can keep our
promises for generations to come.
Sustainability means profits must be tied to purpose. The first half is just as
important as the second. Without profits a public company will not be able
to fulfill its purpose for very long. I am pleased that MetLife delivered strong
financial performance in 2018. We generated 5 billion of net income and
5.5 billion of adjusted earnings driven by solid underwriting good volume
growth disciplined expense management and tax reform. We grew adjusted
earnings per share by 37 percent and achieved an adjusted return on equity
of 12.6 percent.i
Strong cash generation helped us return a record 5.7 billion to shareholders
in 2018 through common stock repurchases and dividends. This was well
ahead of our 5 billion target and demonstrates our commitment to being
good stewards of our shareholders’ capital.
Capital is precious and our goal is always to deploy it to its highest and
best use. When we have opportunities for organic growth or acquisitions
that exceed our cost of equity we will pursue them—and in fact MetLife
deployed more than 3 billion toward new business growth in 2018. But when
we do not we will return excess capital to shareholders as we should. 
Chairman’s Letter 2
Share buybacks have come under criticism in certain quarters on the
grounds that they are unfair to workers. In politics the temptation is to set
up diametrically opposed positions—either you’re completely on the side
of workers or you’re completely on the side of shareholders. The truth is
you should be for both.
I agree with those who say if you’re not providing for your employees and
just giving back money to your shareholders that’s not a fair deal. Some have
argued that before you do buybacks you should pay all workers at least
15 an hour offer seven days of paid sick leave and offer decent pensions
and reliable health benefits. I’m proud that MetLife does all of these things
and more. In fact we used a portion of the proceeds of tax reform to improve
the benefits we offer our workers.
But you have to take care of your shareholders as well. They have given you
money to invest for them and their families and you have an obligation to
provide them a fair return. A lot of middle-income people have their retirement
funds invested in MetLife through mutual funds or other institutional investors.
They benefit when we pay dividends and repurchase shares.
I believe it would be a mistake to let the government start making capital
allocation decisions for companies. Our free-market system has the best track
record of any economic system in allocating capital where it will produce the
greatest wealth for the greatest number of people.
In addition to our strong financial performance MetLife made good progress
operationally in 2018. We successfully remediated the material weaknesses
associated with our group annuity business in the United States and our
run-off Japan variable annuity business in the MetLife Holdings segment.
Both material weaknesses were lifted as announced in our 10-K.
Our focus since we self-identified and self-reported the group annuity issue
has been to enhance our processes so that we deliver better service to our
customers. Going forward we will further strengthen our ownership culture
so that employees continue to feel empowered to escalate issues quickly.
This is the best way for us to live up to the high standards we set for
ourselves. Our financial performance is—and should be—tied to the value
we create for our customers and the experience we deliver for them.
MetLife’s Path of Transformation
Since I announced my retirement I have been asked many times about my
legacy at MetLife. I think of it in two ways. First I believe I helped de-risk the
company on both the financial and regulatory fronts. And second I helped
strengthen the company operationally providing a solid foundation for a new
era of profitable growth.
Eighteen months after I joined the company in 2005 as Chief Investment
Officer we sold Peter Cooper Village/Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan for
5.4 billion. While this was regarded as a historic top-of-the-market asset
sale it was actually a de-risking move. That one property had risen so much
in value that it represented nearly 50 percent of our entire real estate equity
portfolio posing concentration risk.
I believe it would be
a mistake to let the
government start
making capital
allocation decisions
for companies.
Chairman’s Letter 3
That same approach to risk guided us as the storm clouds of the financial
crisis began to gather. I am proud that we saw the housing bubble earlier
than most and took action to significantly reduce our holdings of subprime
mortgage-backed securities. We also saw the recession coming in October
of 2007 two months ahead of the official start and made a decision to sell
down billions of dollars of assets we thought would be most vulnerable in
a downturn.
Our efforts to de-risk MetLife’s asset portfolio helped us come through
the financial crisis in such strong financial shape that we were able to buy
Alico from AIG for 16.4 billion helping AIG repay U.S. taxpayers and making
MetLife a truly global insurance company.
When I became CEO in May of 2011 I knew our major task would be to
de-risk our liabilities just as we had de-risked our assets. After going public
the company had been growing the top line with complicated guarantees
that produced impressive GAAP earnings but with poor underlying
economics. While we had exited the long-term care business the prior
year largely because some of us in leadership viewed the liabilities as
unhedgeable we were still selling a number of products that would not
perform well in a lower-for-longer interest-rate environment.
Initially I thought that exiting universal life with secondary guarantees and
ratcheting down variable annuity sales would get the job done. Eventually
we realized the best course would be to spin off our U.S. retail business
altogether and create two distinct value propositions for shareholders. Our
goal for MetLife was clear: drive up our return on equity while driving down
our cost of equity. We have made great strides toward this goal. MetLife is
a less volatile company than it was in 2011 with a lower beta which has
allowed us to deliver returns in excess of our cost of equity capital.
While the decision to separate Brighthouse Financial made strong
economic sense it was still not easy. The hardest part was the emotional
component. This was our core business dating all the way back to our
founding in 1868 and the decision to separate was the most difficult one
I faced during my tenure.
At the same time as we were de-risking we were improving MetLife’s
economics by boosting free cash flow and the value of new business written.
We expanded capital-light businesses with high internal rates of return and
shorter payback periods and we fixed or exited businesses that failed to meet
those criteria. As a result our ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings rose
from 26 percent in 2012 to an average of 66 percent over 2017 and 2018.ii
This stronger free cash flow has enabled MetLife to repurchase more than
10 billion of common shares over the last five years and increase our common
dividend at an 11.4 percent compound annual growth rate since 2011.
The life insurance business is long term by its nature. We create value for
customers by making promises that can extend for decades and the profits
from the business we write often emerge slowly. In an environment that is
very short-term focused this requires discipline and determination.
Sometimes we must make tough decisions that do not maximize near-term
GAAP earnings in favor of doing the right thing for the company over the
Our goal for
MetLife was clear:
drive up our return
on equity while
driving down our
cost of equity.
Chairman’s Letter 4
long run. This is how we have tried to run MetLife over the past eight years
with a focus on creating value for customers and shareholders over time.
Operationally MetLife has made tremendous strides as well. When I became
CEO we faced a number of challenges. Our cost structure was inefficient.
Our customer service was not where it needed to be and our approach to
technology and digital was status quo. We have reshaped the company on all
three fronts.
On cost MetLife is now top quartile in tech-spending efficiency among
large insurance peers. This has helped contribute to an overall 140 basis
point improvement in our direct expense ratioiii since 2015. MetLife made a
commitment in 2016 to deliver 800 million in pre-tax margin improvement
by 2020 and we remain on track to do so.
These savings have not come at the expense of needed investments.
Across the enterprise we have invested in technology to improve the
customer experience. In our U.S. centers we have improved across all key
metrics over the last six years: Net promoter scores are up by 139 percent;
first-call resolution has increased by 36 percent; customer satisfaction has
improved by 21 percent; and we have received five J.D. Power certifications
for customer service across our call centers.
No less important has been our focus on the future. The threat of disruption
is real and MetLife has not been standing still. Partnering with Techstars we
have launched a Digital Innovation Accelerator to identify mentor and give
us early access to disruptors in the insurance space. We have also launched
a Global Digital Venture Fund to partner with venture capital firms pilot best
concepts and broaden our own thinking. Finally LumenLab our innovation
hub in Singapore is driving a culture of innovation across MetLife with a goal
of reshaping how we engage with customers. In April 2019 LumenLab’s work
on a blockchain-supported product won MetLife a spot on Forbes’ first-ever
Blockchain 50 list.
An Existential Threat
In the midst of all these efforts we were confronted with a regulatory
risk larger than any MetLife had faced in its history. Because we won our
SIFI suit decisively it may be hard to remember how ominous the threat
appeared in 2013.
The actions of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the
Federal Reserve at the time made two things clear: First only three out of
more than 800 U.S. life insurers would be labeled SIFIs and second the
capital requirements for SIFIs could have been significantly higher than
for other firms. We viewed this as an existential threat that would make it
impossible for MetLife to price many of its products competitively and
lead to the potential breakup of the company into multiple pieces to the
detriment of customers and shareholders alike.
The Dodd-Frank Act included a provision allowing companies to seek
judicial review of their SIFI designations. No company wants to take the
federal government to court but this was a path I felt we must pursue for
The threat of
disruption is real
and MetLife has not
been standing still.
Chairman’s Letter 5
the sake of our customers employees and shareholders. On the merits we
felt that FSOC was simply wrong. MetLife did not meet the definition of a
“systemic” financial institution as outlined in Dodd-Frank. We are not that
interconnected with other financial institutions and our liabilities subject
to a “run on the bank” are nowhere near large enough to destabilize the U.S.
financial system.
In addition FSOC failed to follow its own rules. It was supposed to assess
MetLife’s vulnerability to “material financial distress.” Instead it simply
assumed we would fail. These errors of both substance and process
caused the federal district court to deem FSOC’s designation of MetLife
“fatally flawed.”
We were given many warnings against challenging the government—you will
lose; your brand will suffer; you will face retribution. But if anything because
we took a principled stand and fought for what we knew was right MetLife
emerged with its reputation enhanced.
I believe it is important for companies to take a public stand and advocate
for policies that are in the best interest of their customers employees and
shareholders. While the SIFI challenge was our most prominent example we
also made our views known on taxes regulation trade and monetary policy.
The pro-growth positions we took many of which became official policy have
helped fuel the strongest U.S. economy in a decade—and better results for
MetLife as well. My advice to business leaders is: Don’t abandon the public
square. Your voice is needed to ensure the preservation of a free-market
system that has done a remarkable job of creating wealth and raising living
standards.
Our Noble Purpose
Underpinning everything we do at MetLife is our noble purpose of providing
financial security to tens of millions of people. By pooling risk investing wisely
and paying benefits when they are needed most we create tremendous
positive social impact. All advanced societies have governmental social
insurance. All of them have also preserved private insurance as a vital
component of the financial safety net that helps people deal with life’s risks.
MetLife’s role as a force for good was on display in many ways in 2018:
• We paid approximately 48 billion in claims and benefits to policyholders.
• We fueled jobs and economic growth by investing 589 billion in total
assets under management for policyholders and clients in agriculture
infrastructure real estate and businesses of all kinds.
• MetLife Foundation fulfilled its five-year commitment to provide
200 million in grants to improve financial inclusion worldwide.
• We were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (North America)
for the third year in a row.
• We were named one of America’s 100 Most JUST Companies by JUST
Capital and Forbes in recognition of our high performance on issues
Americans define as priorities for good corporate behavior.
My advice to
business leaders
is: Don’t abandon
the public square. 
Chairman’s Letter 6
Conclusion
It has been a tremendous honor for me to lead this great company. My goal
was to leave MetLife better than I found it and I believe that is what we
have done over the past eight years. We’ve divested businesses that were
not meeting our return hurdles we’ve invested in technology to improve our
operations and the customer experience and we’ve set the company on a
path to profitable growth.
There are many people I want to thank including the Board of Directors
for their support especially during our long SIFI battle. I want to thank the
Executive Group for helping to turn the ship to put us on a better course.
They took our strategy from words on paper to action on the ground. I want
to thank those who worked with me in the Office of the CEO who made
everything run smoothly.
Most of all I want to thank MetLife’s employees. Any company’s success
is the sum total of the contributions made by its people. Those of us in
leadership often receive the credit but it’s those in the trenches who do
the hard work every day. The amount of transformation that has occurred
at MetLife is remarkable and our employees should take great pride in their
accomplishments.
Finally on behalf of the entire Board of Directors I want to express our
confidence that we are leaving the company in great hands. Michel Khalaf
has brought deep knowledge of our industry an entrepreneurial spirit and
strong leadership skills to each of the roles he has held during a long and
successful career in the life insurance industry.
Michel shares my pride in the value we create for shareholders the protection
we provide to our customers the opportunities we create for our employees
and the positive impact we make on society. I wish him every success.

toward our goal of sustained balanced
top-line growth bottom-line growth and
cash generation and leadership levels of
value creation for you our shareowners.
We finished above the top end of our going-in
guidance range on core earnings per share we
exceeded our cash targets with another strong
year of value returned to shareowners and while
we were slightly below our target on sales growth
we continued to improve market share trends.
We did all of this while facing market contractions
currency devaluations transportation disruptions
and trade inventory reductions as well as rising
commodity and freight costs.
Core earnings per share were 4.22 an 8% increase
above the high end of our going-in target range.
This includes headwinds from commodity costs
which rose throughout the year as well as benefits
from the U.S. Tax Act. All-in GAAP earnings per share
were 3.67 a decline of 34% due to a fiscal year
2017 comparison period that includes a substantial
earnings gain from the Beauty Brands divestiture
and one-time non-core charges related to the
U.S. Tax Act in the current year.
We delivered strong free cash flow results generating
14.9 billion of operating cash flow. Free cash flow was
11.2 billion with adjusted free cash flow productivity
of 104% well above our target of 90%.
We targeted organic sales growth of 2% to 3% for
the fiscal year. We delivered 1%. Collectively eight of
our 10 product categories grew organic sales over 3%.
This growth was partially offset by results in Baby
Care and Grooming both of which were down versus
the prior year.
A number of our large markets had strong organic
sales growth with China being a bright spot as we
continued our strong turnaround there. In China two
years ago organic sales were down 5%. We finished
this year up 7% with accelerated sales growth as the
year progressed?—?6% in the first half and 8% in the
second half which included 10% organic sales growth
in the fourth quarter. Six of seven categories held
or grew sales up from one of seven categories two
years ago. This was significant progress in our second
largest market for both sales and profit. In addition
India delivered double-digit organic sales growth
while Mexico and Japan both delivered mid-singledigit organic sales growth.
Importantly we improved market share trends in
seven of our 10 global product categories throughout
the year. In our largest countries eight of the 15
improved versus the prior year with fourth quarter
trends better than fiscal year average in 10 of 15.
In the U.S. which accounts for around 40% of sales
all-outlet value share improved from a decline versus
prior year in fiscal year 2017 to in-line with prior
year in fiscal 2018 improving throughout the year
to overall share growth in the April–June quarter.
Our global e-commerce sales were strong up
30% for the year and accounted for nearly 4.5
billion of sales?—?about 7% of our total business.
For perspective this is roughly the size of our
two largest e-commerce competitors combined.
And we held or built e-commerce value share
in eight of 10 product categories.

All-in sales grew 3% including a net benefit from
the impacts of foreign exchange acquisitions
and divestitures.
We continued to dependably generate cash and
return value to you our shareowners. In total P&G
returned more than 14 billion of value to shareowners.
We repurchased approximately 7 billion of stock
and paid 7.3 billion in dividends. We increased our
dividend by 4% marking the 62nd consecutive annual
increase and the 128th consecutive year P&G has paid
a dividend?—?every year since our incorporation in 1890.
In summary we grew core earnings per share above
our going-in target we drove cash productivity ahead
of target we returned cash to shareowners and we
improved market share trends. We grew sales but
modestly below our target range. Overall we made
important progress but we have room to improve
on all metrics?—?especially on top-line growth.
Going forward our objective remains consistent and
clear?—?balanced top-line growth bottom-line growth
and cash generation that consistently delivers total

We’re confident that we have the right strategy and
plans in place.
However we’re operating in a very dynamic environment
with changing government policies geopolitical
uncertainties retail channel transformation disruption
of the media ecosystem rising input costs and foreign
exchange headwinds and we’re competing against
highly capable multinational and local competitors.
That is why we are accelerating change to meet these
challenges and further improve results. This will enable
us to spot and capitalize on opportunities?—?and identify
and fix issues?—?faster than we ever have in the past.
We will be the disrupters in our industry.

DRIVING SUPERIORITY
ACROSS CHANNELS
We’re focused on growing where consumers
shop?—?whether that’s in-store or online.
This year P&G grew organic sales 30% in e-commerce
the fastest-growing retail channel around the world.
P&G also provides a superior experience in-store.
An independent benchmarking survey* that
measures retailer perceptions of manufacturers
across seven key focus areas ranked P&G #1
for the third year in a row.

Always Discreet Before we launched Discreet in the
U.S. one in three women stated they experienced adult
incontinence but only one in nine was using a product
designed for her needs. Meaningful superiority is driving
sales growth in Always Discreet adult incontinence
products of more than 25% in fiscal year 2018.
The brand is reaching new record share levels across all
markets and contributing to 11 consecutive quarters of
organic sales growth in P&G’s Feminine Care category.
In the eight markets where we’ve launched Discreet
category growth has accelerated as much as 50%.
Merck KGaA Acquisition P&G’s acquisition of the Consumer
Health business of Merck KGaA*—?a fast-growing business
that generates about 1 billion in annual sales?—?will offer
consumers a broader range of therapeutic products across
a wider geographic scope and bring significant technical
and commercial capability in-house.
ADULT INCONTINENCE
Adult Incontinence is a large and fast-growing segment?—?
about 3 billion in retail sales and growing in the
high single digits?—?and P&G is leading that growth.
OVER-THE-COUNTER HEALTH CARE
An aging population and an increased consumer
focus on wellness make the personal health care
category very attractive.
DRIVING SUPERIORITY
IN GROWING SEGMENTS
We’re driving superiority in important growing
segments to better meet changing
consumer needs and desires.
Pampers Pure Protection The natural baby care segment
is over 5% of the category and growing double digits.
Pampers Pure Protection diapers launched in April in the
U.S. are made with no chlorine bleaching fragrance or
parabens and deliver outstanding dryness and protection.
In tracked retail channels Pampers Pure is now the #1
selling diaper in the natural diaper segment.
Plant-Based Fabric Care Consumers shouldn’t have to
choose between plant-based and cleaning power. That’s
why we created Tide purclean?—?the first plant-based
laundry detergent with the cleaning power consumers
expect from Tide. We’ve expanded our innovation with
Dreft purtouch Gain Botanicals and Downy Nature
Blends to offer a full family of plant-based fabric care.

we deliver on the business success metrics
80% of the time.
Where we achieve three or fewer superiority
measures we do not deliver on our desired
business outcomes.

SK-II
SK-II’s superiority has driven sales
growth of over 20% for 15 quarters.
The Prestige Beauty market is
growing high single digits with
SK-II growing share of the category.
Downy & Lenor
Scent Beads
Scent beads are the fastest-growing
form of fabric enhancers in the Fabric
Care category growing at a rate of
about 20% while P&G’s scent beads
are growing about 30%. Downy
known outside North America as
Lenor is just one example.
Here are just two examples from our Skin &
Personal Care and Fabric Care categories.
All SK-II products are based on a
proprietary formula with a signature
ingredient Pitera. SK-II’s bestseller?—
Facial Treatment Essence?—?contains
over 90% Pitera and works to transform
all five dimensions of skin.
Scent beads reset consumer expectations
for scent performance and experience.
The form is fun engaging and simple to
use?—?just toss in the washer and enjoy
12 weeks of freshness from wash until
wear. Scent beads are driving U.S. fabric
enhancer category growth of mid-single
digits in fiscal year 2018.
PRODUCTS
SK-II is presented in prestige packaging
that builds the brand’s equity and
consumer confidence in the product.
Limited-edition packages featuring
artist collaborations are designed to
enhance consumer engagement.
P&G’s distinctive and appealing
scent beads packaging shows off
the product and lets consumers
experience the fragrance benefit
at the store shelf with a squeeze
scent-release.
PACKAGING
In Japan P&G’s Lenor scent beads
household penetration has increased
by 27 percentage points over the past
12 months supported by compelling
brand messaging that clearly
communicates the product benefits.
SK-II’s brand-building efforts?—?like the
Change Destiny movement and bold
Facial Treatment Essence campaigns
like the Bare Skin Project?—?have helped
grow new SK-II users by more than
23% and contributed to 15 consecutive
quarters of sales growth including more
than 30% growth in fiscal year 2018.
BRAND
COMMUNICATION
This combination of product package
communication and retail experience
delivers consumer delight that
supports SK-II’s premium position.
In the markets where SK-II is present
the brand is tied for the #1 position
in super-premium skin care.
CONSUMER & CUSTOMER
VALUE EQUATIONS
Consumers see the value and there is
tremendous upside. Global scent beads
household penetration is only about 15%
and beads are used in only about 8%
of laundry loads.
RETAIL
EXECUTION
At SK-II counters a beauty consultant
personalizes the skin care experience
with state-of-the-art skin analysis. SK-II
creates immersive retail experiences
like the Future X Smart Store enhanced
by facial recognition and AI. Digital
analytics support a meaningful
consumer connection contributing
to SK-II’s strong online share of 20%.
When we showcase a Fabric Care
product regimen at shelf and online
with our “Better Together” product
lineup category growth is 1–2 percentage
points ahead of the average driven by
consumers adding fabric enhancers like
scent beads to their shopping baskets. 
DRIVING SUPERIORITY
ACROSS AGE GROUPS
Millennials are more likely to prefer and purchase
familiar brands and do much of their shopping
online. This year we held or grew share in
eight of our 10 categories in e-commerce.
50+ Consumers By 2030 there
will be over 2 billion consumers aged 50+
representing half of all consumer spending
and a significant growth opportunity.
Accelerating Noticeable
Brand Superiority
Our basis for competitive advantage is meaningful
and noticeable superiority in all elements of our
consumer proposition?—?products packaging
brand communication retail execution (in-store
and online) and superior value?—?in each price tier
where we compete.
Superiority starts with superior products?—?products
so good consumers easily recognize the difference.
Superior products are delivered in superior packages?—
packaging that attracts consumers conveys the
brand equity and closes the sale. Superior product
and packaging benefits need to be communicated
with exceptional advertising that engages consumers.
Superior retail execution in-store means having the
right store coverage product forms sizes price points
shelving and merchandising execution. Online it
means having the right content assortment ratings
reviews search and subscription offerings. The last
element is superior consumer and customer value
equations. For consumers this means the value of the
total proposition?—?product package communication
retail execution and price. For customers it includes
margin penny profit trip generation basket size
and category growth.
Superiority builds brand relevance across age groups.
At least 17 of P&G’s top 20 U.S. brands are #1 or #2 in
market share in any age group including millennials
and the 50+ consumer.
PRODUCTS
The data shows that superiority drives our business
but no single element is a magic bullet. It’s the
combination across all elements that creates winning
brands. Where we achieve superiority on at least
four of the five elements we deliver on all measures
of business success 80% of the time?—?growing
household penetration (more households using
our brands in a given year) growing the market
and growing market share sales and profit. Where
we achieve just three or fewer of the elements
of superiority we do not deliver our desired
business outcomes.
When we get this model in place we drive growth.
There are quite a few examples of where this is
happening including our Fabric Care business
in the U.S. Japan and several markets in Europe;
our Feminine Care business in North America
China and Europe; SK-II; Olay in China; and Fairy and
Dawn hand dishwashing liquids in many markets.
Delivering accelerated organic sales growth requires
superiority in our current core business?—?in each
key price tier in each key product form in our
largest and fastest-growing markets and in all trade
channels where consumers shop for our products.
It also requires that we deliver superiority in
emerging consumer benefit areas like naturals
and sustainable products. We’re improving in each
of these areas and we are selectively enhancing our
portfolio through acquisitions as we are doing in the
Personal Health Care category with the acquisition
of Merck KGaA’s Consumer Health business which
is expected to close during fiscal year 2019.
We’re making good progress but we face highly
capable competitors who continue to innovate.
We will continue to invest to address these
challenges and extend our product and package
advantages superior execution and consumer
and customer value propositions.
We’ve invented a breakthrough
technology with the capacity to
revolutionize the plastics recycling
industry. It separates color odor and

for it to unlock the potential for billions of pounds of
high-quality recycled plastic to replace virgin materials
for P&G and many other companies.
PACKAGING

INNOVATION PRINCIPLES
Pampers Pure diapers in the
U.S. reached the market in 18
months?—?about half the time
of a typical rollout in the very
capital-intensive diaper market.
We brought Pantene Micellar
Shampoo to market in four
months less than one-third
the time usually required for
a new shampoo launch.
Development of both products
was accelerated by partnerships?—?
co-designing with retailers and
working with suppliers to create
the materials needed.
Air Assist packaging designed for
e-commerce shipping of liquids
delivers significantly better in-use
experience and reduces plastic
by 50%?—?and we’ve just started
licensing the technology.
This Swiffer Duster package
can be shipped directly from
e-retailers with no additional
outer box reducing complexity
offering greater sustainability
and lowering packaging cost.
SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGIES
We’re innovating faster and more cost effectively

Delivering Productivity
to Fuel Investments
We will continue to drive productivity improvement
to fund investments in superiority improve our
industry-leading margins and generate cash.
We successfully completed a 10 billion productivity
program in fiscal 2016 and we are approaching the
midpoint of our second five-year productivity program
on track to deliver another 10 billion. We are driving
cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets
of the business.
We’re dramatically transforming our supply chain.
Over the past few years we have made major
investments into the supply chain to ensure it
remains a competitive advantage for P&G.
We’re driving down cost and inventory with our
Supply Network Transformation. We’re making
progress toward our vision of synchronizing the supply
chain with real-time point-of-sales data with consumer
purchases triggering updates to our manufacturing
schedules in plants and orders of materials to suppliers.
Our six new mixing centers in North America are
enabling faster customer response times and
optimized mixed-product loads to improve
customer service levels.
We’re also taking steps to reinvent the media supply
chain and how our brands work with agencies and
we’re pioneering new approaches to continually
improve our brand building.

We’re returning to one-stop agency shops where
it makes sense reuniting media and creative. We’re
implementing “fixed and flow” models reducing the
number of agencies on fixed retainers while flowing
creative resources “in and out” as-needed. These
changes not only reduce the number of agencies
and save money but lead to better quality greater
creativity and faster ad-development cycle times.
We’re using data and technology to move from
wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand
building. For example in China where 70% of our media
is digital and 30% of our sales are in e-commerce we
have one of the largest data management platforms
in the country which we use for consumer analytics.
We can effectively manage frequency and engage
people when and where it matters. We have saved
30% of digital spending in China while increasing
digital reach by 60%.
Another area we’re focused on is cash productivity.
An important cash productivity project has been
supply-chain financing which we continue to expand.
This program is a win both for suppliers and for P&G
and has yielded nearly 5 billion dollars in cash in
the five years we’ve been driving it.
Overall productivity improvement will be critical to
fund investment for sales and market share growth
while continuing to expand our profit margins.
Supplier Integration
• Co-locating suppliers in
plants reduces truck traffic
and distribution cost
• Increased synchronization
of P&G’s operations with
our suppliers leads to
lower inventory and
other costs
Customer Collaboration
• With new U.S. mixing
centers 80% of shipments
are within 24 hours of
retailers
• Leads to higher in-stock
levels and lower cost
of goods
DELIVERING PRODUCTIVITY
BY REINVENTING MARKETING
Reinventing agency partnerships
from outsourcing too much of our work
to getting our hands on the keyboard.
Reinventing advertising from
mass clutter to less doing more.
Reinventing media from wasteful mass blasting
to mass reach with one-to-one precision
enabled by data and technology.
Reinventing brands to be a force for good
and a force for growth?—?people want to know
what brands and companies believe in.
Productivity provides fuel for
innovation and investment to
accelerate and sustain faster
top- and bottom-line growth.

Improving our
Organization and
Culture to Win
We continue to change our organization structure and
culture to position us to win in the changing retail and
competitive landscape. We have more to do but we are
simplifying the structure and clarifying responsibility
and accountability by tailoring the organization to win
by category and by market. One market where this is
making a difference is in Greater China which moved
from a decline of 5% in organic sales two years ago to
7% organic sales growth this year behind by-category
programs specifically designed to win in China.
To speed up decision-making we’re moving more
resources to our business units. This includes a
significant portion of Corporate resources so they
can be closer to the consumers we serve with
higher accountability more agility and greater speed.
In addition we’re adding sales people in markets
like China and India.
At the same time we continue to drive more mastery
and depth in each category to supplement our internal
talent with skilled experienced external hiring.
We are also strengthening our compensation and
incentive programs. For example based in part on
shareowner input we have made changes to ensure
manager compensation better reflects our financial
performance versus external competitive benchmarks.
Recent changes include increasing the percentage of
total compensation at risk increasing the weighting
more toward category results versus Company results
widening the payout factors to 0% to 200% of target
and increasing the number of people participating in
the program?—?better linking rewards to performance.
All these organization and culture changes are
aimed at creating a company that is more agile
more accountable more efficient and more
productive?—?designed to win with consumers
at the speed of the market.
Building Citizenship
into Building the
Business
We continue to build Citizenship into how we deliver
our business results. Our aspiration is to be a positive
force for good and for growth across each area of our
Citizenship work: Ethics & Corporate Responsibility
Community Impact Diversity & Inclusion Gender
Equality and Environmental Sustainability.
For example we’re making good progress on
Environmental Sustainability already achieving several
goals that we set for 2020. Looking ahead we have
established broad-reaching Ambition 2030 goals aimed
at enabling positive impacts on the environment while
creating value for consumers and shareowners such
as making all product packaging for our 20 leadership
brands completely recyclable or reusable cutting
greenhouse gas emissions from our manufacturing
sites in half and continuing to help stem the flow
of plastic into oceans.
In the area of Community Impact we continue to
improve communities around the world with programs
like Tide Loads of Hope which provides laundry services
to those struck by disaster; P&G Children’s Safe Drinking
Water Program which has provided more than 13 billion
liters of clean drinking water; and our Pampers UNICEF
campaign which has helped eliminate maternal and
newborn tetanus in 20 countries.
We continue to lead on Diversity & Inclusion and
Gender Equality because we know more ideas for
growth are realized when diverse people come
together to offer their best performance and that
economic empowerment for consumers from all
walks of life can lead to market growth. In the last
We’ve made an
important shift to
more performancebased compensation
for our employees.

year we increased representation for women now at
46% of all P&G managers globally and we increased
our U.S. representation and workplace satisfaction of
African Ancestry Hispanic and Asian Pacific American
employees while also making our workplaces and
communities around the world more inclusive for
women the LGBT+ community and people with
disabilities. And as the world’s largest advertiser
we are using our broad reach to spark important
conversations that motivate positive change along
racial ethnic sexual orientation and identity
disability and gender lines.
P&G’s commitment to Citizenship is supported by our
Purpose Values and Principles. They are the foundation
on which this Company was built and they have been
our guiding force for more than 180 years.
Committed to Win
We continue to raise the bar to improve the lives of
the world’s consumers with consumer-preferred brands
and products and to deliver even stronger results
for you our shareowners.
In the year ahead we expect to grow organic sales 2%
to 3% grow core earnings per share 3% to 8% and deliver
90% or better adjusted free cash flow productivity.
And we expect to pay over 7 billion in dividends and
repurchase up to 5 billion of common shares.
This is another step toward our goal of sustained
balanced top-line growth bottom-line growth
and cash generation which yields operating total
shareholder return in the top third of our peer group.
While the current environment is highly dynamic
I’m confident in the determination and capability
of P&G people to win in even the most challenging
of circumstances and serve consumers and shoppers
better than anybody else in the world.
It’s through our efforts to extend our margin of
competitive superiority to drive productivity savings
to fund investments for growth and enhance our
industry-leading margins and to simplify our
organization structure and increase accountability
that we’ll win with consumers and deliver balanced
top- and bottom-line growth that creates value
over the short mid- and long term.

Organic growth*
7.61

The year 2018 will be remembered for
many things at United Technologies.
A year of record sales and earnings.
A year in which the Otis maintenance
portfolio exceeded 2 million units for
the first time. A year in which Pratt &
Whitney manufactured more than
1000 large commercial and military
engines for the first time in more
than 30 years. And a year in which
Carrier grew its top line by 6 percent
organically while introducing more
than 100 new products. 2018 also saw
the completion of the Rockwell Collins
acquisition which combined with our
UTC Aerospace Systems business
allowed us to create the preeminent
aerospace systems supplier now
named Collins Aerospace Systems.
The most momentous decision in 2018
however was our decision to return United
Technologies to its roots as a preeminent
aerospace systems supplier while establishing
Carrier and Otis as standalone independent
companies. This decision perhaps the most
difficult decision a Board of Directors can
make will establish three industry-leading
focused businesses that will drive long-term
value for investors customers and employees.
Underpinning all the successes of 2018 is
our relentless focus on delivering the most
advanced and innovative products and
services to our customers around the world.
And all this was possible only through the
dedication and diligence of our 240000
employees. As I have said many times
companies don’t innovate people do.
Likewise companies don’t design develop
manufacture or service our products people
do. So please join me in thanking all the people
of United Technologies who have made this
great performance in 2018 possible. Here are
some additional highlights.
STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
In 2018 United Technologies had sales of
66.5 billion driven by 8 percent organic
growth. Earnings per share on an adjusted basis
were 7.61 a 14 percent increase over 2017.
Spending on research and development totaled
4 billion of which more than 2.5 billion was
company-funded. We generated 6.3 billion
of cash flow from operations and we invested
1.9 billion in capital expenditures to fund
future organic growth. Net free cash flow was
4.4 billion. Dividends totaled 2.2 billion
and in October 2018 the Board approved a
5 percent increase in the dividend rate to
2.94 per share on an annual basis.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM OUR BUSINESSES
In addition to manufacturing over 1000 large
commercial and military engines Pratt &
Whitney signed a 2 billion contract to supply
F135 engines in support of the Joint Strike
Fighter program. Revenue from commercial
maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO)
services increased significantly and the
Geared Turbofan engine aftermarket network
continued to mature more than doubling the
number of engines overhauled in our shops
compared to 2017.
Gregory J. Hayes
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
United Technologies Corporation 03
Collins Aerospace extended its industry
leadership in 2018. The business was awarded
a contract to provide nacelles for the Dassault
Falcon 6X and selected to provide content on
Boeing’s U.S. Air Force T-X jet trainer including
the ACES 5 ejection seat landing gear and
wheels and brakes. The company also enjoyed
significant demand for its wheel and brake
systems as more than 35 airlines selected
its equipment representing commitments
totaling more than 500 million. Commercial
aftermarket sales at legacy UTC Aerospace
Systems were strong as well up 12 percent
organically in 2018.
Against a backdrop of challenging geopolitical
conditions our commercial businesses also
achieved many successes.
Carrier opened a state-of-the-art building
technology and customer experience center
in Palm Beach Gardens Florida. More than
12000 customers and guests have already
seen firsthand how our innovative products
and services work together to enhance
building efficiency. The Carrier business which
represents nearly 80 brands across heating
and air-conditioning refrigeration fire and
security and building automation solutions
continued its product innovation acceleration
launching more than 200 new products in the
past two years. In 2018 Carrier streamlined
and strengthened its portfolio through the
divestiture of equipment manufacturer Taylor
Company and the acquisition of S2 Security
a leading developer of unified security and
video management solutions.
A focus on innovation also helped Otis
to reap its share of big wins in 2018. The
business landed significant contracts for
Resorts World Las Vegas SNCF French rail
the Bangkok Metropolitan Rapid Transit in
Thailand and Haikou Twin Towers in China.
Otis also strengthened its leadership in China’s
infrastructure segment securing contracts
to supply more than 2500 elevators and
escalators to metro rail and airport projects
in 11 cities. Investment in digital also began
to bear fruit with the launch of a new digitally
enhanced Otis Signature Service and the IoTenabled Otis ONE platform that uses remote
diagnostics data analytics and machine
learning to predict and prevent shutdowns.
GROWING OUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT
The relentless pace at which products and
services are becoming digitally enabled and
connected is fundamentally transforming
how we live and work. Our team in the new
United Technologies Digital Accelerator in
Brooklyn New York delivers fresh thinking
and capabilities to the design of innovative
customer experiences streamlined
manufacturing capabilities and intelligent
solutions that unlock new forms of value.
Our accelerator houses a growing community
of digital experts who are passionate about
making things smarter more efficient and
more connected. Core to our digital
capabilities is data analytics and in 2018
we acquired Predikto Inc. an analytics
software company known for its cloud-based
predictive technology.
Our technology R&D investments and activities
are increasingly focused on high-impact areas
that are critical to United Technologies’ future
growth. These include connected products
autonomy and electrification—and they are
among the top priorities for our team at the
United Technologies Research Center. In 2018
we launched United Technologies Advanced
Projects (UTAP) under the leadership of our
Chief Technology Officer. UTAP blends a fastpaced start-up-like culture with UTC’s deep
technical expertise to develop high-risk/highreward product demonstrators.
INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE
United Technologies is a global team of
talented purpose-driven professionals. Many
are leaders in their communities—volunteering
to make a positive social impact mentoring
schoolchildren encouraging STEM education
and building a more sustainable future.
We remain committed to being an open
inclusive and diverse company. As part of
the Paradigm for Parity coalition we are
committed to achieving gender parity in our
senior leadership by 2030. We graduated the
first classes from our Re-Empower Program
which helps individuals get the confidence
support and training needed to re-enter
the workforce after a voluntary absence. In
2018 we invested more than 100 million in
employee learning and job training programs.
And as a leadership team we are investing our
time in sponsorship preparing future leaders
who will one day sit in our seats.
THE PATH AHEAD
I couldn’t be more excited about the future
of our company. Our businesses are wellpositioned to benefit from the global trends of
rapid urbanization an expanding middle class
and unprecedented growth in commercial
aviation. We have the size scale and talent
to thrive. As we embark on this historic
transformation to become three strong
industry-leading companies I am energized
by the challenges and opportunities before us.
In closing I want to again express gratitude
to our employees for a remarkable year. Thank
you also to our valued customers for placing
your trust in us and our products. And my
thanks to you our shareowners for investing
in us."
47,FedEx,65450,50,60319,357000,Frederick W. Smith,Chairman &  Chief Executive Officer,Transportation,Mail Package and Freight Delivery,25,Memphis,TN,35.1495343,-90.0489801,"Putting our networks to work: How FedEx multiplies opportunities across the world
To connect is a basic human impulse. The more connections we make — at home at work in our communities — the better our lives become. The networks we create with others broaden our thinking.

Similarly with our mission to connect people and possibilities FedEx has created vast global networks that power the world’s economy. Everywhere FedEx operates we put our size scale and connections to use for good — multiplying positive outcomes for people businesses and the environment. Essentially the FedEx “multiplier effect” creates more value for society at large.

Multiplying economic growth
We stimulate global economic growth in several ways.

We empower entrepreneurship. Each year FedEx awards small-business grants through a small business contest. The 2018 grand prize winner Rumi Spice partners with more than 300 farmers and nearly 2000 women harvesters in rural Afghanistan to source sustainably farmed saffron. The company was founded by two former U.S. Army officers who wanted to catalyze rural economic development in the country and empower women through direct wages. FedEx services help these entrepreneurs reach markets far and wide.

We generate jobs. Besides the more than 450000 team members around the world we also spur job growth in our communities. For example FedEx Ground FedEx Express FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical rely on independent businesses for certain types of pickup-and-delivery linehaul transportation and other services. Our contracts with them support small businesses and local economies employing tens of thousands of people worldwide. During FY18 we procured 9.6 billion in goods and services from diverse and small-business suppliers in the U.S. alone. Of that amount 9 percent was spent with women-owned businesses and 15 percent with minority-owned businesses with the remaining 76 percent spent with other small business suppliers.

We foster e-commerce. While the business-to-business market is much larger the business-to-consumer e-commerce market is growing faster. We’ve expanded our retail networks to give our customers even more locations to pick up ship packages or have them held. Currently they can do that at 12000 convenient secure retail locations such as Walgreens and Walmart stores. As a result 80 percent of the U.S. population is within five miles of a FedEx hold location. Our growing retail network also positions us to play a key role in reverse logistics by enabling our business customers to restore refurbish or reuse returned products.

We advocate for global trade. We support ambitious trade agendas that provide opportunities for our customers our team members and FedEx. This includes supporting policies in the U.S. and overseas that strengthen the future of the world marketplace. We advocate for greater customs clearance efficiency around the globe and we urge trade facilitation policies that reduce administrative costs. This especially helps small and medium-sized companies which are most disadvantaged by complicated and costly customs procedures.

Multiplying good for our communities and team members
It’s important to our customers and to FedEx that we effect positive change in the world. We do that through a corporate social responsibility strategy that includes:

The FedEx Cares giving and volunteering platform
“Safety Above All” focus throughout FedEx
Career development and opportunity programs for team members
Efficient sustainable operations and services
In FY16 we committed to give 200 million to 200 communities by 2020. As of the end of FY18 we’re ahead of plan for number of communities (now 252) and on track to meet our total contribution goal early. This past fiscal year we gave 55.1 million in corporate charitable contributions 8.98 million in team member United Way contributions and 81976 volunteer hours contributed by more than 13000 team members.

As noted we put safety first in the air on the roads and everywhere we operate. We source the most up-to-date safety technology for our transportation equipment facilities and yards. For example we’re testing platooning in our highway trucks which allows tractors with drivers to follow each other in a safe controlled manner through vehicle-to-vehicle communication and safety features such as collision mitigation. At FedEx Ground we’re piloting virtual reality training modules to improve safety techniques related to dock behavior and large package lifting. Our FedEx Express Indianapolis hub now offers a slip-and-fall simulator to enable team members to experience real-life dangers in a safe environment. We set the highest standards for safety training throughout FedEx.

While we work to provide the safest workplaces for our team members we are also broadening their career and education opportunities. That’s part of our People-Service-Profit philosophy the bedrock of FedEx since day one. In FY18 we provided our people more than 24000 online courses and 11.4 million in tuition assistance. Here are a few more workforce development examples from FY18:

As a global company FedEx values the talent and perspectives of team members everywhere. A far-reaching cultural initiative is underway at FedEx Express which includes a cross-cultural multinational network of team members empowered to support the continued integration of TNT and build an inclusive culture in all countries afterwards based on FedEx values.
At FedEx Office a new Diversity and Inclusion website updated interview guides and orientation materials to reflect the company’s inclusive philosophy.
We committed 2.5 million to create the FedEx Purple Runway Aviation Scholarship program to educate aspiring pilots aircraft maintenance technicians and other aviation professionals. Purple Runway will help FedEx train our pilots of the future.
We partnered with the University of Memphis to provide FedEx Express team members in the Memphis Indianapolis Oakland Los Angeles and Newark facilities the chance to earn a tuition-free online degree.
The FedEx Services Internship Program now has more than 50 percent minorities. This past fiscal year the program received about 16000 applications (up 2000 from last year) to fill 170 summer intern positions. We typically hire around 70 percent of the selected interns for full-time employment.
Not only do we motivate our team to excel we also recognize them when they do. Company-wide team members received almost 48400 awards in FY18. More than 50 of those were to team members who showed selfless courage responding to those in need particularly in life-threatening situations.

Multiplying efficiency and sustainability
At FedEx we operate responsibly efficiently and sustainably. To these ends we developed our “Reduce Replace Revolutionize” approach to FedEx aircraft vehicles facilities and materials. The program focuses on improving productivity while creating new more efficient solutions.

From FY09 through FY18 we’ve decreased CO2 emissions intensity (on a revenue basis) by about 37 percent. Last fiscal year alone we avoided 2.7 million metric tons of CO2e emissions from fuel- and energy-saving initiatives throughout our operations. That’s equivalent to the carbon kept out of the atmosphere by more than 3 million acres of U.S. forests in one year. We’re realizing aircraft-efficiency benefits from fleet modernization and fuel conservation programs that saved more than 200 million gallons of jet fuel and avoided almost 2 million metric tons of CO2e emissions in FY18. Last year we ordered an additional 12 Boeing 777 Freighters and 12 Boeing 767 Freighters which are much more fuel efficient than the aircraft they will replace.

FedEx Express is working to improve vehicle fuel efficiency 50 percent by 2025 from a 2005 baseline. As of FY18 the operating unit has achieved nearly 40 percent improvement. In November 2018 we announced we will expand our vehicle fleet by adding 1000 Chanje V8100 electric vehicles (EVs). These will be operated for commercial and residential pickup-and-delivery in California. The EVs can travel more than 150 miles when fully charged and will save 2000 gallons of fuel while avoiding 20 metric tons of emissions per vehicle each year.

We’ve also made great strides converting to sustainable materials. In FY18 almost 100 percent of all paper bought by FedEx Office was third-party certified. As such 88 percent of that was Forest Stewardship Council certified. More than half of FedEx-branded packaging was made from recycled content in FY18 with all FedEx packaging being recyclable.

____________________

By continuing to connect more people and possibilities while giving back to our communities and our planet FedEx will ensure that its multiplier effect benefits the world. This report gives a summary of what we accomplished in FY18 and a preview of the great things yet to come for FedEx and the billions of people we serve.

And we’ll become Better by continuing to
integrate our purpose agenda into our business
strategy and doing even more for the planet and
our people. Under my predecessor Indra Nooyi’s
leadership Performance with Purpose became
a cornerstone of PepsiCo guiding our strategy
and serving as a point of true differentiation. We
are proud of the progress we have made and
equally excited about the continued evolution of
our purpose agenda. With this in mind we are
committing to Winning with Purpose which will
elevate our sustainability agenda.

Our team delivered a solid performance in 2018 meeting the growing and evolving global needs of our agricultural
industrial animal nutrition and food and beverage customers. The result was a year in which in an environment of trade
disruptions we delivered strong results while continuing to advance our strategy.
The safety and health of the colleagues and partners working in our facilities remains our highest day-to-day priority. This
was our 18th consecutive year of reducing recordable injuries and December overall was the safest month ever for our
employees. However we know from experience that complacency is the enemy of continued progress and that we can still
do better so ADM continues to maintain a relentless focus on safety.
From an overall financial perspective we continued to execute our balanced capital allocation framework which — along
with strong operating cash flow generation — resulted in a solid balance sheet at the end of the year.

Across all four of our businesses our teams performed very well:
• Origination delivered full-year adjusted operating profits of 546 million 35 percent higher than in 2017. The team
planned in advance and moved swiftly to manage changing trade flows allowing us to minimize disruptions and capitalize on new opportunities. Simultaneously we continued to grow our value-added services with the destination
marketing team achieving our growth goal of 20 million metric tons in origination volumes a year earlier than our
original target.
• Oilseeds had a very strong year delivering record profits up almost 80 percent over 2017 and showing how our
truly global diversified business can capitalize on growing demand in dynamic market conditions. The team did well
managing risk in a volatile market and delivering growth utilizing our asset base flex capacity and growth investments to set strong performance records.
• The Carbohydrate Solutions team showed how innovation and creative problem solving can help mitigate the
impact of challenging market conditions. We grew sweetener sales year over year by working closely with major
customers to find new solutions for evolving needs and we moved swiftly to capitalize on opportunities in a growing
starches market. Bioproducts results were lower year over year in a weak ethanol industry pricing and margin environment.
• The Nutrition business continued its strong growth as investments helped contribute to sales that were up almost
7 percent versus 2017 on a constant currency basis and operating profits that were 9 percent higher year over year.
Through continued collaboration with our customers we were able to provide innovative solutions across our growth
platforms — including animal nutrition health & wellness human nutrition and taste — as well as increase our sales
growth pipeline by 50 percent over 2017.
Our team achieved all of this while simultaneously advancing our strategic plan:
In our efforts to Optimize the Core we:
• Divested our Bolivian oilseeds business;
• Sold several elevators in the U.S. further optimizing our origination footprint; and
• Led significant turnarounds in our global trade and South American origination businesses.
As part of our work to Drive Efficiencies we:
• Delivered cost savings of more than 300 million on a run-rate basis significantly outpacing our target of
200 million; and
• Began working with industry peers to investigate ways to use emerging digital technologies to standardize and digitize time-intensive processes associated with the global agricultural commodity value chain.
In our Growth pillar our investments helped to contribute to the year’s strong performance and lay a strong foundation
for future growth:
• In our Core Growth platform we announced GrainBridge an important joint venture with Cargill in the digital
innovation space; launched our SoyVen joint venture which operates a soybean processing facility in Egypt; and grew
our Brazilian Oilseeds crush and value-added footprint with the addition of certain assets of Algar Agro including two
crushing and refining facilities. We also completed a significant modernization of our flour mill in Enid Oklahoma.
• In Animal Nutrition we completed negotiations to acquire Neovia a truly transformational addition that after closing
in early 2019 instantly made ADM a global industry leader in value-added products and solutions for both production
and companion animals. We also celebrated the opening of modernized production facilities in Illinois and Nebraska.
• In Health & Wellness we acquired leading natural healthcare and probiotics provider Protexin and opened a new
enzyme research lab in California.
• In Human Nutrition we continued to expand our global network of customer innovation centers with openings in
Singapore and Shanghai and we began commissioning our state-of-the-art pea protein facility in Enderlin North
Dakota.
• In Carbohydrates we launched our AKP joint venture expanding our global starches and sweeteners business into the
Russian market.
• In Taste we added premium vanilla producer Rodelle Inc.
We also continued to advance critical Sustainability efforts in 2018:
Diversity and Inclusion
Throughout 2018 several organizations recognized ADM’s efforts to build an inclusive culture and diverse workforce.
Profiles In Diversity Journal gave its 2018 Innovations in Diversity Award to “Together We Grow” a consortium that ADM
co-launched in 2016 to focus on educating recruiting and retaining a more diverse workforce in the agriculture sector and
named two ADM leaders as “Women Worth Watching”; USG Corporation named our company as its Diversity & Inclusion
Supplier of the Year; and The Rising Tides recognized our Board and executive leadership team as one of the most diverse
among Fortune 50 companies.
We are proud of the increasing recognition we’re receiving but we know we have to do more. In January of this year we
announced a partnership with Paradigm for Parity® and a commitment to achieving gender parity within our senior
leadership structure by 2030. We will continue to prioritize building an inclusive and diverse culture throughout 2019 and
beyond.
Environmental Stewardship
Our focus on sustainable practices and environmental responsibility remained a focus in 2018 as well. We have already met
— ahead of schedule — our own ambitious goals for energy greenhouse gas water and waste reduction. I am proud that
we are being recognized for our efforts: ADM was named an Industry Mover in the RobecoSAM Sustainability Yearbook
2018 and last November the Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture awarded its 2018 Collaboration of the Year Award to
ADM along with General Mills and Agrible for our work helping farmers in Kansas Oklahoma and Missouri to measure and
improve management of natural resources.
Overall 2018 was a strong year and I am proud of how the ADM team performed. Now we are well into 2019 and fully
focused on continuing to pull the levers under our control to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders.
There are three key areas we will be prioritizing this year.
• The first is continuing to improve the performance of certain businesses. As we continue to optimize the core we have
established specific year-over-year improvement targets for those businesses that need to further strengthen their
performance. We plan to rigorously monitor their performance throughout the year and take further actions if necessary to ensure that they meet our expectations. At the same time we will ensure that stronger businesses sustain and
build on previous gains.
• The second is Readiness. Our effort to standardize processes globally drive overall performance excellence and digitize the enterprise underpins our entire strategy. 2018 was the year in which we launched Readiness and embedded
the change within the whole organization. We identified thousands of initiatives to standardize centralize and digitize how we do business. By the end of the year we had already completed 120 of those initiatives generating
300 million in new run-rate benefits. 2019 is when we expect Readiness to accelerate as we take our current bank of
prioritized initiatives and deliver projects and cultural change that taken together will permanently change how we
run our business creating a lasting structure under which we will be more efficient and more effective.
• The third priority area is growth — specifically ensuring that the growth investments we have made in recent years
fully deliver on their profit and returns potential. Since 2014 we have dramatically expanded our portfolio and our
geographic reach with both organic growth projects and M&A activity. All told we have made more than 7 billion in
growth investments over the last five years. Now with an unparalleled portfolio of products and ingredient solutions
in key growth markets around the world 2019 is the year we focus on harvesting increasing returns from those
investments.
ADM is following a clear path for success as our strategy our innovation and our people continue to differentiate us. I am
proud of the results we have delivered and remain confident that we are building a great and enduring company for 2019
and years to come.

to Our Shareholders
The Board values this opportunity to share our perspectives regarding the work we undertook for our shareholders during 2018.
Our objective is to guide and oversee management in the creation of long-term value through the execution of a sound business
strategy thoughtful succession planning a commitment to corporate ethics careful risk oversight prudent risk management
talent development and creating societal impact. In pursuit of these objectives we are pleased to share with you an overview of
the Board’s priorities and actions during the year.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
We believe that an optimal and effective board of directors is informed active and constructively engaged with management
without undue disruption to the day-to-day business of the Company. Our Board meets regularly to discuss Prudential’s strategic
direction. Our collective skills and experience in the areas of regulation business operations risk management and capital
markets among other areas enable us to provide critical insights to the Company to help maximize shareholder value. At each
Board meeting and during our annual strategy planning session we engage with Prudential’s senior leadership in robust
discussions about the Company’s overall strategy priorities for its businesses and long-term growth opportunities.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Board collaborates with our executive team to cultivate a deep talent bench and plan for senior leadership succession. In
2018 as part of our succession plan we made changes among the Company’s most visible leadership roles. The appointments
of Charlie Lowrey to succeed John Strangfeld as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Rob Falzon to succeed Mark Grier as Vice
Chairman are the culmination of a multiyear rigorous succession-planning effort by the Board. This structure is modeled in part
after the roles John and Mark established working together over the past decade. We are grateful to John and Mark for their
leadership and the contributions both have made to Prudential. John will be leaving the Board on April 5 2019 and Mark is
expected to retire from the Company and leave the Board in August 2019. At that time Rob Falzon will join the Board.
CULTIVATING A STRONG ETHICAL CULTURE
Our Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee has direct oversight for the Company’s overall ethical culture and
human rights policy. The Board collaborates with management to establish and communicate the right ethical tone which guides
our conduct and helps protect the Company’s reputation. We know that only by doing business the right way every day do we
continue to earn our investors’ and customers’ trust. Our commitment to strong ethical values and doing business the right way is
reflected in Ethisphere Institute’s naming of Prudential as a 2019 World’s Most Ethical Company®. This recognition is bestowed
only on organizations that demonstrate a culture of ethics and transparency at every level.
BOARD RISK OVERSIGHT
The Board sets standards for managing risk and monitoring the management of those risks within the Company. The Risk
Committee is comprised of the chairs of each Board committee which recognizes the vital role of each committee in risk
oversight and enables the directors to more closely coordinate the Board’s risk oversight function. The Risk Committee has
metrics in place to monitor and review market insurance investment and operational risk. We regularly review the Company’s
risk profile including its approach to capital management its operational footprint and its investment risks and strategies. The
Board considers the breadth of the Company’s risk management framework when approving its strategy and risk tolerance and
verifies that strategic plans are commensurate with our ability to identify and manage risk.
TALENT DEVELOPMENT
The diversity of experiences backgrounds and ideas of Prudential’s global employees enables us to develop solutions that
address the financial needs of our customers. Therefore recruiting developing and retaining top diverse industry talent is a key

priority for the Company. Talent development is discussed at every Board meeting and once per year the Board devotes time to
discuss talent at each business and functional leadership level across the Company. This engagement gives us rich insight into
the Company’s pool of talent and its succession plans.
CREATING POSITIVE SOCIETAL IMPACT
Prudential was founded on the belief that financial security should be attainable by everyone. Delivering business results and
creating societal impact has guided our business model for more than 140 years. By leveraging the full breadth of Prudential’s
business capabilities the Company harnesses the power of the capital markets to promote economic opportunity and sustainable
growth. To make sure the Company is delivering on its promise of inclusion the Company has a Corporate Social Responsibility
Oversight Committee. The Committee meets three times per year and is comprised of Board members and Prudential senior
executives.
ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH
As a Board one of our priorities is listening to and considering the views of our shareholders as we make decisions in the
Boardroom. We accomplish this through a robust outreach and engagement program. In 2018 we spoke to investors who
represent a majority of our outstanding shares. Topics discussed included Prudential’s sustainability and social strategy Board
composition and refreshment Board leadership structure succession planning and our executive compensation program.

strategic and operational initiatives propelled us to #61 on the Fortune 500® list of America’s

significant revenue and earnings growth and creating greater opportunities for margin expansion.
We ended 2018 as a 60 billion enterprise and our success this past year was punctuated by the

At Centene we don’t just embrace the future we take the lead. We are a company in motion and
we are taking action to build on our competitive strengths to drive further growth. We continued to
see our strategic approach yield results in 2018. Centene offers approximately 350 solutions

Centene as a leader in the nation’s four largest Medicaid states. Fidelis has maintained its strong
operating performance throughout our successful integration while the acquisition has expanded
our reach in Medicare Advantage and the Health Insurance Marketplace. Looking forward it is
clear that we have an incredibly bright future. We have clear sight on new opportunities. We’re
expanding our U.S. footprint and we are growing internationally. This positions us to continue
delivering results for our members communities and shareholders.
DRIVING GROWTH
Centene drove organic growth in our core products of Medicaid Medicare and the Health
Insurance Marketplace in 2018. We were successful in reprocurement and service expansion wins
in multiple markets and in 2019 we are expanding our Medicaid geographical footprint with new
contracts in Iowa and New Mexico. In addition we grew our portfolio of Medicare products offering
Medicare Advantage and D-SNP plans in eight new Centene Medicaid states which will help bring
our Medicare product solutions to a total of 20 states. And we are the number one insurer in the
nation on the Health Insurance Marketplace. In 2018 we had strong marketplace enrollment of
over 1.6 million members at the peak representing 35% growth over 2017 open enrollment metrics.
We now offer access to the Health Insurance Marketplace in 70% of our markets having already
expanded into four new states for 2019 and exploring additional expansion activities for 2020.
Beyond these core offerings we remain the largest provider of managed long-term services
and supports one of the fastest-growing segments in the managed care market. Our Centurion
product is the market leader in correctional health by revenue and is widely recognized for its high
standards for quality and care and its innovative and transparent approach. In addition through
our TRICARE program we continued to be one of the nation’s largest providers of managed care
services for military families.
We also continue to gather international momentum by leveraging our public sector and
population health expertise as well as our technology and analytics capabilities to advance our
position in the Spanish and UK markets. At the end of 2018 Centene acquired an 89% ownership
in University Hospital of Torrejón serving approximately 150000 people with a broad portfolio of
services and facilities. This investment furthers the reach of our successful whole health model.

BUILDING ON OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
Our core beliefs have stood the test of time and today as we build on those foundations through
new technologies and innovations we are able to take bold steps forward while remaining true
to our purpose of transforming the health of the community one person at a time.
For example we are proactively streamlining our organization to achieve efficiencies protect
quality and outcomes and capture the best of our capabilities and talents. In 2018 we launched
Centene Forward an initiative designed to generate operating and economic efficiencies and
accelerate margin expansion. Through Centene Forward we expect to realize up to 500 million
in savings over a multiyear period. In addition to long-term savings this initiative will provide us
with additional capital to invest in capabilities and technologies that better position Centene
for long-term growth increased margins and enhanced profitability.
We continue to invest in technology which enhances our ability to scale coordinate and
deliver care. With our focus on innovation we deliver the next generation of healthcare services
through new IT platforms enhanced data analytics and technology-based partnerships. In 2018
we introduced RxAdvance a solution for pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and have been
pleased with its early performance. We will continue this implementation across our health
plans throughout 2019 and 2020 and will consistently leverage new technology to improve
health outcomes.
We are also driving integrated innovation through our organization. Through our Health Care
Enterprises group highlighted by Casenet’s TruCare solutions we are improving health
outcomes by developing more efficient care models and reducing healthcare costs. We also
made a significant investment in Interpreta an innovative health IT company focused on clinical
and genomic data and analytics. Interpreta can rapidly identify physiological or laboratory
changes by analyzing 12 million medical data points in less than a minute which allows for
continuous interpretation of each patient’s past present and future care needs.
Our ongoing initiatives build on more than 30 years of experience in applying our local approach
to government-sponsored healthcare programs. Centene goes beyond traditional healthcare
partnering with states and other key stakeholders to offer programs and services that address
the health and social needs of our country’s most vulnerable populations. This commitment
is a core piece of Centene’s business strategy.
LEADING THE WAY FORWARD
The healthcare industry is ever-changing as the nation debates the shape and scope of healthcare
policy. That said the midterm elections of 2018 demonstrated that there is bipartisan support to
provide high-quality efficient and affordable care to all Americans. This goal has been Centene’s
focus and commitment for more than 30 years. We will continue focusing on what we can control.
As an exceptionally local fully integrated tech-enabled enterprise we deliver consistent
year-over-year market expansion by strategically optimizing our core business.
Ultimately Centene’s success is due to the talent skill and dedication of our more than 47000
employees as well as their commitment to providing the highest quality of care to the vulnerable
populations entrusted to us. From the leaders we develop through our leadership training programs
at Centene University to the individual employees running local programs to promote healthier lives
for our members it is our workforce that facilitates our growth. I want to thank our employees for
their commitment passion and innovation which enable Centene to deliver on our mission to
provide better health outcomes at lower costs. I also want to use this opportunity to note my
appreciation for the guidance and leadership of our Board of Directors.
We have a clear line of sight into our growth drivers for 2019 and beyond. We will keep building
on our momentum to deliver enhanced value to shareholders as we transform the health of our
communities one person at a time.

Forward-looking statements contain information about future operating or financial performance. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions about market conditions and our future operating performance which the Company believes to be reasonable at this time. The Company's results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and these expectations and assumptions involve risks and uncertainties including changes in macroeconomic conditions and the Company's industry failure to achieve anticipated synergies and cost-savings increased rates of food price inflation or deflation and other factors that could cause actual results or events to be materially different from those anticipated. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (collectively the ""Non-GAAP Measures"") are performance measures that provide supplemental information the Company believes is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate its ongoing results of operations when considered alongside other GAAP measures such as net income operating income and gross profit. These Non-GAAP Measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing the Company's ongoing operating performance and thereby facilitate review of its operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different capital structures or different lease terms and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by the effects of acquisition accounting on its depreciation and amortization. As a result of the effects of these factors and factors specific to other companies the Company believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide helpful information to analysts and investors to facilitate a comparison of its operating performance to that of other companies. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for additional items defined in its debt instruments for board of director and bank compliance reporting. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

three-year plan financial objectives but also built a strong foundation to
help us achieve our current 2018-2020 plan goals.
Financial Performance1
Overall in fiscal 2018 we saw solid financial performance and are pleased with
our results. Sales grew 6.1% to 58.7 billion driven by local case growth of

growth and we grew adjusted operating income by 8.4 percent to 2.5 billion.
Additionally adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 0.66 to 3.14.

including solid gross profit dollar growth that exceeded adjusted operating
expense growth which culminated in us delivering 665 million in adjusted
operating income improvement.
Strategic Priorities
We recognize that in order to build upon our recent strong financial
performance we must continue to evolve our business. In December
2017 we outlined four strategic priorities which we believe will serve as
the roadmap for additional value creation and acceleration of the current
growth of the company.

to help our customers be successful and drive additional customer loyalty

Looking back at the past few years I’m enormously proud of how far we’ve come. We set out on a journey to reinvent everything about our company – from our brand and our products to our culture and the role we play in the communities we serve.

Our 2018 results demonstrate the incredible progress we’ve made. It was an exceptional year for HP and a clear indication that our strategy is paying off. We are innovating across our core businesses capitalizing on new growth opportunities and making strategic investments to position our company for success well into the future.

We drove 12% revenue growth in FY18 adding more than 6.4 billion to our top line. We delivered 22% non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share (“EPS”) growth reflecting the strength of our operational performance disciplined investment strategy and prudent cost-management. We generated 4.2 billion free cash flow and returned 3.5 billion to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And we did all of this while advancing key strategic initiatives that are enhancing our long-term competitiveness.

We are consistently executing and winning with customers and partners while simultaneously fulfilling the commitments we made to our shareholders.

Stockholders
It continues to be an exciting time in healthcare
as the industry is beginning to show signs
of true transformation including movement
toward a more integrated holistic approach
to affordable care using value-based payment
models focused on improving the health
outcomes of consumers. This evolution is more
important than ever given our country’s aging
population and continued growth in the number
of chronic conditions seniors are facing. We
believe that companies like Humana that are at
the forefront of this change have the greatest
opportunity to improve the lives of the millions
of people we serve.
Humana had a strong year of growth and
success in 2018. Fueled by strong Medicare
Advantage results and the success of our
integrated care delivery model we reported
adjusted earnings per diluted common share
(EPS) of 14.55 an increase of over 24 percent
compared to adjusted EPS of 11.71 in 2017.
Strong Medicare Advantage membership gains
during 2018 and our transition to providing
healthcare services to more military service
members retirees and their families under the
new TRICARE East Region contract led to over
18 percent growth in our membership base
reaching 16.6 million members at year-end.
Despite our exit from the individual commercial
business as of January 1 2018 we reported
revenues of 56.91 billion in 2018 exceeding
revenues of 53.77 billion in 2017 again backed
by the strong performance of our Medicare
Advantage business. As we move further
into 2019 we intend to continue to advance
our consumer and health-focused strategy
recognizing the importance of being on the
leading edge of value-based care.
This movement toward value-based care is
highly dependent on the health engagement
of consumers and providers. As such we are
keenly focused on removing friction points to
simplify the experience and creating personal
and relevant interactions. We are pleased to see
recent external actions aimed at the removal
of the most significant barriers to this change.
For example the government’s interoperability
efforts have led to an increase in the volume
and velocity of information available from the
implementation of technology that puts the
entire health record of a Medicare patient at
their fingertips giving them the power to decide
who may access that information. In the end
it’s the healthcare consumers who benefit as
it makes it easier for them to understand and
participate in their health journey with their
doctors and caregivers.
Bruce Broussard President and Chief Executive
Officer and Kurt Hilzinger Chairman of the Board
We have also seen changes to reimbursement
models like Medicare Advantage including the
expansion of reimbursement to cover services
that address social determinants such as
food insecurity and social isolation which can
have a significant positive impact on people’s
health. Finally we are seeing a growing number
of providers adopt value-based payment
models armed with predictive data models
and more information to proactively monitor
intervene and assist their patients to prevent
the occurrence of a significant health event.
As more personalized and predictive care is
extended beyond the current physical and
provider boundaries innovations like remote
monitoring combined with technological
advancements like cloud computing and
integrated and agnostic data sets will greatly
improve the quality of healthcare in our
country.
Throughout this transformation we have seen
Humana’s integrated care delivery model
improve health outcomes as demonstrated by
an increase in Healthy Days1
and a reduction
in inpatient hospital admissions. We now see
care moving to lower-cost outpatient settings
like the home our members’ location of choice
for receiving care. Our desire to drive the most
impactful and effective clinical outcomes has
led us to focus on what we have found to be
five key areas of influence—Primary Care the
Home Pharmacy Behavioral Health and
Social Determinants.
Medicare Advantage
membership has
shown strong
g
Five key areas
of influence
Primary Care
In 2018 we continued to expand our valuebased care footprint which now totals 233
owned joint venture and alliance seniorfocused primary care clinics the majority
of which are payer-agnostic. This expansion
leverages the expertise and capital of our
partners to test innovative models like our pilot
of two Partners in Primary Care clinics inside
Walgreens stores in Kansas CityiMissouri. In
addition the south Florida and Texas provider
operations were combined under a single
physician-governed brand Conviva to
optimize the operating model and increase
physician engagement.
Home Care
In the home our acquisition of a 40 percent
interest in Kindred at Home and Curo Health
Services—combined to create the nation’s
largest home health and hospice provider
with 65 percent overlap with our individual
Medicare Advantage membership—provides
us a unique opportunity to transform
the in-home care model to one based on
clinical outcomes as opposed to volume. In
2018 our management teams worked to
establish Kindred at Home as an independent
home health company integrated the Curo
acquisition and launched four home health
pilots focused on testing care and payment
models oriented to patients with multiple
chronic conditions combined with the delivery
of care through telehealth in the home.
Pharmacy
Turning to pharmacy we are pleased that
Humana Pharmacy was ranked the No. 1
mail-order pharmacy by J.D. Power based
on our exemplary service. We continue to see
industry-leading mail-order penetration rates
and remain focused on the importance of
medication adherence in slowing or preventing
disease progression. We recognize value-based
payment models improve this health measure
as evidenced by for example 3 percent better
diabetes medication adherence2
for Medicare
Advantage members receiving care from a
provider in a value-based arrangement versus
those in a FFS arrangement.
Behavioral Health
Behavioral health is at the core of our clinical
care offerings as we recognize the significant
impact mental health has on an individual’s
physical health and well-being. To drive better
clinical outcomes we expanded our internal
behavioral health model to our nearly 6 million
c
i 
Outside our clinic strategy we continued
to expand value-based relationships with
primary care providers through contractual risk
arrangements often leveraging the capabilities
of our Medical Services Organization or MSO.
Under both our clinic model and contractual
arrangements we now have 67 percent of our
individual Medicare Advantage members with
providers in value-based arrangements which
are critical for their improved quality of care.
For example among our providers in a
value-based payment arrangement we see a
5 percent reduction in hospital admissions
per thousand members (APT)2
7 percent
fewer emergency room visits per thousand
members (VPT)2
and 15.6 percent lower
medical costs for patients compared to
Original Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS).2
We now have 67
percent of individual
Medicare Advantage
members with
providers in valuebased arrangements
TRICARE members in 2018 and we are now
beginning to insource our Medicare Advantage
behavioral health offerings beginning
with Florida.
Social Determinants
Lastly regarding social determinants we
continue the work of our Bold Goal—to
improve the health of the communities
we serve 20 percent by 2020 and
beyond—by partnering with local community
agencies and programs to expand access to
critical support systems that address food
insecurity and social isolation among other
endeavors. A senior who is food insecure
is much more likely to have a higher rate
of chronic conditions and increased health
struggles—50 percent more likely to be
diabetic3
14 percent more likely to have high
blood pressure3
60 percent more likely to have
congestive heart failure (CHF) or experience a
heart attack3
and three times higher prevalence
of depression.3
Seniors living in our Bold Goal
communities continue to outperform other
communities we measure in terms of having
fewer Unhealthy Days. For perspective each
additional Unhealthy Day is associated with
approximately 16 higher medical costs per
person per month.4
Importantly we also continued to advance our
core operations in 2018 returning to strong
Medicare Advantage membership growth
expanding our Medicaid operations as one
of only two companies awarded a statewide
Florida contract and exiting our individual
commercial business and non-core closed block
of long-term care insurance policies. We made
significant investments in our consumer and
provider-facing technology and announced the
planned launch of Studio H a Boston-based
initiative focused on pioneering new digital
health products and services. Studio H will help
us accelerate the development of a critical
capability—creating a simplified connected
and personalized healthcare experience for
our members provider partners and other
caregivers.

Looking ahead to the remainder of 2019 we
will continue the momentum of 2018’s success
by executing and proving out investments we
have made in our consumer-focused health
strategy integrating clinical services and
insurance products to improve the health of our
members. We are building the infrastructure to
facilitate internal and external interoperability
increasing data computing and developing
more agile consumer experience enhancement
tools. The combination of these investments will
accelerate key capabilities for the integrated care
delivery model such as increasing the sharing of
data among clinicians proactive identification
and closing of gaps in care combined with an
increase in productivity for our clinical partners.
We are also refining our products to offer a more
personalized experience based on customer
segmentation to address the functional and
emotional needs of our members. While we have
more work to do we are proud that Humana was
recognized by Newsweek as Best in Customer
Service among health insurance companies in
the magazine’s new “America’s Best Customer
Service 2019” rankings and we will continue to
focus on providing exemplary service for
our members.
We are excited about our opportunity to improve
the lives of the millions of people we serve
while helping lead the way in transforming the
future of our industry. We owe our success
in no small part to our employees members
clinical and governmental partners and
shareholders. We especially want to thank
our approximately 42000 employees for their
dedication commitment and skill in serving
our members. We are proud to enter 2019 with
employee engagement at an all-time high in
the 92nd percentile representing world-class
engagement. Our thanks also goes out to our
members for choosing and entrusting us to serve
their most important and personal needs—their
health. We would also like to thank our clinical
and governmental partners for their collective
commitment in working with us to improve
population health through actions that put
healthcare consumers first resulting in better
outcomes and reduced costs. And finally we
would like to thank you our stockholders. Thanks
for your commitment to our organization and for
believing in our mission.

57,Facebook,55838,76,40653,25105,Mark Zuckerberg,Chairman &  Chief Executive Officer,Technology,Internet Services and Retailing,7,Menlo Park,CA,37.4529598,-122.1817252,"For 2018 my personal challenge has been to focus on addressing some of the most important issues facing our community -- whether that's preventing election interference stopping the spread of hate speech and misinformation making sure people have control of their information and ensuring our services improve people's well-being. In each of these areas I'm proud of the progress we've made.

We're a very different company today than we were in 2016 or even a year ago. We've fundamentally altered our DNA to focus more on preventing harm in all our services and we've systematically shifted a large portion of our company to work on preventing harm. We now have more than 30000 people working on safety and invest billions of dollars in security yearly.

To be clear addressing these issues is more than a one-year challenge. But in each of the areas I mentioned we've now established multi-year plans to overhaul our systems and we're well into executing those roadmaps. In the past we didn't focus as much on these issues as we needed to but we're now much more proactive.

That doesn't mean we'll catch every bad actor or piece of bad content or that people won't find more examples of past mistakes before we improved our systems. For some of these issues like election interference or harmful speech the problems can never fully be solved. They're challenges against sophisticated adversaries and human nature where we must constantly work to stay ahead. But overall we've built some of the most advanced systems in the world for identifying and resolving these issues and we will keep improving over the coming years.

We've made a lot of improvements and changes this year and here are some of the most important ones:

For preventing election interference we've improved our systems for identifying the fake accounts and coordinated information campaigns that account for much of the interference -- now removing millions of fake accounts every day. We've partnered with fact-checkers in countries around the world to identify misinformation and reduce its distribution. We've created a new standard for advertising transparency where anyone can now see all the ads an advertiser is running to different audiences. We established an independent election research commission to study threats and our systems to address them. And we've partnered with governments and law enforcement around the world to prepare for elections.

For stopping the spread of harmful content we've built AI systems to automatically identify and remove content related to terrorism hate speech and more before anyone even sees it. These systems take down 99% of the terrorist-related content we remove before anyone even reports it for example. We've improved News Feed to promote news from trusted sources. We're developing systems to automatically reduce the distribution of borderline content including sensationalism and misinformation. We've tripled the size of our content review team to handle more complex cases that AI can't judge. We've built an appeals system for when we get decisions wrong. We're working to establish an independent body that people can appeal decisions to and that will help decide our policies. We've begun issuing transparency reports on our effectiveness in removing harmful content. And we've also started working with governments like in France to establish effective content regulations for internet platforms.

For making sure people have control of their information we changed our developer platform to reduce the amount of information apps can access -- following the major changes we already made back in 2014 to dramatically reduce access that would prevent issues like what we saw with Cambridge Analytica from happening today. We rolled out new controls for GDPR around the whole world and asked everyone to check their privacy settings. We reduced some of the third-party information we use in our ads systems. We started building a Clear History tool that will give people more transparency into their browsing history and let people clear it from our systems. And we've continued developing encrypted and ephemeral messaging and sharing services that we believe will be the foundation for how people communicate going forward.

For making sure our services improve people's well-being we conducted research that found that when people use the internet to interact with others that's associated with all the positive aspects of well-being you'd expect including greater happiness health feeling more connected and so on. But when you just use the internet to consume content passively that's not associated with those same positive effects. Based on this research we've changed our services to encourage meaningful social interactions rather than passive consumption. One change we made reduced the amount of viral videos people watched by 50 million hours a day. In total these changes intentionally reduced engagement and revenue in the near term although we believe they'll help us build a stronger community and business over the long term.

If you're interested in reading more about these changes I've written extensively about our work on elections here (https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/preparing-for-elections/10156300047606634/) and content governance and enforcement here (https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-blueprint-for-content-governance-and-enforcement/10156443129621634/). You can also read about our research on well-being here (https://newsroom.fb.com/…/hard-questions-is-spending-time-…/).

I've learned a lot from focusing on these issues and we still have a lot of work ahead. I'm proud of the progress we've made in 2018 and grateful to everyone who has helped us get here -- the teams inside Facebook our partners and the independent researchers and everyone who has given us so much feedback. I'm committed to continuing to make progress on these important issues as we enter the new year.

I'm also proud of the rest of the progress we've made this year. More than 2 billion people now use one of our services every single day to stay connected with the people who matter most in their lives. Hundreds of millions of people are part of communities they tell us make up their most important social support. People have come together using these tools to raise more than 1 billion for causes and to find more than 1 million new jobs. More than 90 million small businesses use our tools and more than half say they've hired more people because of them. Building community and bringing people together leads to a lot of good and I'm committed to continuing our progress in these areas as well.

Here's to a great new year to come."

On August 1 2018 Energy Transfer Equity L.P. (“ETE”) Energy Transfer Partners L.P. (“ETP”) and certain of their affiliates entered into a
merger agreement (as may be amended from time to time the “merger agreement”) pursuant to which Streamline Merger Sub LLC a wholly owned
subsidiary of ETE will merge with and into ETP with ETP continuing as the surviving entity and a subsidiary of ETE (the “merger”). The board of
directors (the “ETP Board”) of Energy Transfer Partners L.L.C. (“ETP Managing GP”) the general partner of Energy Transfer Partners GP L.P. the
general partner of ETP approved and agreed to submit the merger agreement and the merger to a vote of ETP common unitholders following the
recommendation of the conflicts committee of the ETP Board (the “ETP Conflicts Committee”). The ETP Conflicts Committee has determined that the
merger agreement and the merger are advisable and fair and reasonable to ETP and in the best interests of ETP and the unaffiliated ETP common
unitholders and the ETP Board has determined that the form terms and provisions of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
including the merger and the ETP LPA amendment (as defined below) are advisable fair and reasonable to and in the best interests of ETP and its
common unitholders and in each case has approved the merger agreement and the merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement subject to certain
adjustments holders of common units representing limited partner interests in ETP (“ETP common units”) will receive for each ETP common unit
held 1.28 common units representing limited partner interests in ETE (“ETE common units”).
The merger consideration to be received by holders of ETP common units is valued at 23.59 per unit based on the closing price of ETE common
units as of August 1 2018 the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger representing an approximate 11% premium to the
closing price of ETP common units of 18.43 on August 1 2018 a 15% premium to the volume-weighted average closing price of ETP common units
for the ten trading days ended August 1 2018 and a 19% premium to the volume-weighted average closing price of ETP common units for the 30
trading days ended August 1 2018. The merger consideration is valued at  per unit based on the closing price of ETE common units as
of  2018 the most recent trading day prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus representing a % premium to the closing price of
ETP common units of  on  2018 and a % premium to the volume-weighted average closing price of ETP common units for the five
trading days ended  2018.
Immediately following the completion of the merger it is expected that ETP common unitholders will own approximately % of the
outstanding ETE common units based on the number of ETE common units outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of  2018. The common
units of ETE and ETP are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbols “ETE” and “ETP” respectively. Following the
consummation of the merger it is expected that ETE will change its name to “Energy Transfer LP” and apply to continue the listing of its common
units on the NYSE under the new symbol “ET.” It is also expected that ETP will change its name to “Energy Transfer Operating L.P.” and that the
Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in ETP and the Series D
Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in ETP will continue to trade on the
NYSE under the symbols “ETPprC” and “ETPprD” respectively.
ETP is holding a special meeting of its common unitholders at  on  2018 at  local time to obtain the vote of its
common unitholders to adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Your vote is very important regardless of the
number of ETP common units you own. The merger cannot be completed unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding ETP common
Table of Contents
units other than the ETP common units owned by ETE and its affiliates and the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding ETP common units
vote for the adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the special meeting. The ETP Board recommends that
ETP common unitholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and “FOR” the proposal
to approve the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting. Pursuant to the merger agreement ETE which directly or indirectly owns all of the incentive
distribution rights and the general partner interest in ETP as well as approximately 2.4% of the ETP common units outstanding as of August 1 2018
has agreed to vote all of the ETP common units owned beneficially or of record by ETE or its subsidiaries in favor of the approval of the merger
agreement and the merger and the approval of any actions required in furtherance thereof. Whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting in
person we urge you to submit your proxy as promptly as possible through one of the delivery methods described in the accompanying proxy
statement/prospectus.
In addition we urge you to read carefully the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus (and the documents incorporated by reference into

III 2018 Annual Report
Delivering Game-Changing Jet Fighters
At Aeronautics we are delivering the most advanced
aircraft and aviation technologies in the world.
Nowhere is this leadership seen more clearly than
in the growth and impact of our globe-spanning
F-35 program.
Nations around the world are seeing the gamechanging capabilities of the F-35. In 2018 the
revolutionary fighter was used in combat for the first
time – by the Israeli Air Force and the U.S. Marine
Corps. With its stealth range and sensor-fusion
capabilities the fifth-generation F-35 is increasingly
seen as a force multiplier that makes every branch of a
nation’s military more integrated and more effective.
In 2018 the program celebrated several international
milestones. We stood with officials from Australia
Japan and the United Kingdom as each marked the
home basing of their first F-35s. Our company also
rolled off the assembly line the first F-35s for South
Korea and Turkey. And in 2018 Belgium chose the F-35
as its fighter of the future.
To meet our strong backlog of orders we continue
to successfully ramp up production. We met our
production targets for 2018 delivering 91 aircraft –
nearly a 40 percent increase over 2017.
In 2018 we also made bold moves to reshape our
operations and prepare for higher production in the
years to come. We opened a new 65000-square-foot
parts manufacturing plant in Pinellas Park Florida. We
expanded our facility in Johnstown Pennsylvania to
provide component final finish work. And we shifted
F-16 production to Greenville South Carolina to better
position our Fort Worth Texas facility to produce a
higher volume of F-35s at an increased rate.
In September 2018 we reached an 11.5 billion
agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense
to build 141 more F-35s for the Low Rate Initial
Production (LRIP) Lot 11. The Lot 11 agreement will
help reduce the cost of an F-35 by more than five
percent over the previous contract and represents an
overall drop in price per jet of more than 60 percent
when compared to the initial production contract. In
November we won an additional 22.7 billion block
buy contract to produce over 250 more F-35 aircraft
for LRIP Lots 12 13 and 14. With these growing
economies of scale we will continue to make the
aircraft increasingly affordable for all our customers.
In addition we are working with the U.S. Air Force to
modernize the only other fifth-generation fighter in the
world the F-22 Raptor. We are adding new capabilities
upgrading the performance of its weapons systems
and providing improved sustainment support and
supply-chain management to ensure the F-22 is a force
for air dominance for decades to come.
The Bright Future for F-16s and Air Mobility
The iconic F-16 fighter continues to find new
customers. In 2018 Bahrain ordered 16 new F-16s.
Slovakia also agreed to purchase 14 new F-16 aircraft
to replace its Russian-made MiG-29 jets. And Bulgaria’s
Ministry of Defense recommended the F-16 Block 70
for the nation’s air force.
We continue to see strong demand for the C-130J
Super Hercules. The transport aircraft now serves
20 nations with Germany the most recent addition.
We delivered a total of 25 C-130Js in 2018 – and hit
a company milestone with one of those 25 being our
400th delivery.
We also marked the 50th year of service for the C-5
which is operated solely by the U.S. Air Force. We
delivered four C-5M Super Galaxy strategic transport
aircraft that we modernized under the USAF’s
Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program
(RERP). Our final delivery of the 52nd C-5M during the
year completed the RERP upgrade which extends the
service life of the C-5 fleet out until the 2040s.
Air-and-Missile Defense and Precision Targeting
Missiles and Fire Control continued to develop and
implement the technologies that help countries keep
their citizens safe.
In December we won a 1.8 billion contract to upgrade
the missile-defense capabilities of U.S. and allied
military forces. The contract is for production and
delivery of Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and
PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE)
interceptors and launcher modification kits for the U.S.
Army and Foreign Military Sales customers.
The high-velocity PAC-3 interceptor can defend against
incoming threats including tactical ballistic missiles
cruise missiles and aircraft. During flight testing in
July our PAC-3 MSE missile successfully intercepted
an air-breathing threat (ABT) representing fixed-wing
aircraft and cruise missiles. This test set the record for
intercepting an ABT with a PAC-3 MSE and reconfirmed
the system’s effectiveness in addressing dangers around
the world.
Lockheed Martin Corporation IV
We welcomed Poland and Sweden as our newest
international customers to procure PAC-3 MSE. To
date 13 nations have chosen PAC-3 and PAC-3 MSE to
provide missile-defense capabilities.
Missiles and Fire Control marked other significant
milestones in 2018. We delivered the 2500th Joint
Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM). And for the
first time JASSM was successfully used in combat
when deployed from the USAF B-1B in operations
over Syria. In addition our Joint Air-to-Ground Missile
(JAGM) program achieved a critical milestone with the
Department of Defense clearing the way for the missiles
to enter low-rate production.
Rotary and Mission Systems
In 2018 our Rotary and Mission Systems business area
leveraged its broad capabilities and technologies to
solve a wide range of customers’ challenges around
the world.
In January we signed a contract with Australia to
design build and integrate the combat system for their
Future Submarine. The contract gives our corporation
a key role in the largest defense capital investment
program in Australia’s history and further deepens our
relationship with this important customer.
Training logistics and sustainment has long been an
area of expertise at Rotary and Mission Systems. Our
leadership in this area was reinforced in March when
the U.S. Army awarded us the Army Training Aids
Devices Simulators and Simulations Maintenance
Program (ATMP). Under this seven-year 3.53 billion
contract we will sustain more than 300000 Training
Aids Devices Simulators and Simulations (TADSS)
including live-fire ranges and instrumentation systems
fielded around the globe.
The Japan Ministry of Defense selected Lockheed
Martin’s Solid-State Radar for their two Aegis Ashore
ballistic missile defense systems in July. Aegis Ashore
will provide Japan with the advanced capabilities it
needs to bolster its layered defenses against current
and future threats.
Another significant achievement took place in October
when the government of Canada selected Lockheed
Martin as the preferred bidder to provide the design
for the Royal Canadian Navy’s future Canadian Surface
Combatant. Our team has put forward a design that
is tailored to meet Canada’s needs by performing a
variety of missions with enhanced survivability and
flexibility for future modernization.
In our Sikorsky line of business we continue to
deliver innovative rotorcraft technologies that our
customers depend on to carry out critical missions. We
reached important milestones in the CH-53K heavylift helicopter and VH-92A presidential helicopter
programs. And our Black Hawk program continued to
find opportunities overseas even as the helicopter
celebrated its 40th anniversary as a workhorse for the
U.S. military.
Leadership in Military and Civil Space
Our Space business area continues to support our
customers’ vital missions to protect their citizens enable
global commerce and advance scientific discovery.
In September the U.S. Air Force selected Lockheed
Martin to build up to 22 next-generation Global
Positioning System III (GPS III) satellites for up to 7.2
billion. The corporation is already producing 10 GPS III
satellites for the Air Force. With the follow-on contract
the additional satellites known as GPS IIIF will provide
increased accuracy flexibility and resiliency for military
and civilian users around the globe.
The Air Force also entrusted Lockheed Martin as
the prime contractor for a new missile warning
satellite system known as Next Generation Overhead
Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR). Next Gen OPIR
will succeed the Lockheed Martin-built Space Based
Infrared System (SBIRS) by providing improved missile
warning capabilities that are more survivable and
resilient against emerging threats. The Air Force
implemented Next Gen OPIR as part of their “Go
Fast” rapid acquisition program which is focused on
quickly fielding new capabilities to maintain America’s
technological advantage over its adversaries.
2018 was also a milestone year for our deep
space exploration programs. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx
spacecraft (Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource
Identification-Regolith Explorer) began orbiting the
asteroid Bennu in December marking the beginning of
a two-year detailed survey that will culminate in the
collection and return of a sample of asteroid material.
The Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft and innovative
sampling system could give scientists insight into the
early formation of our solar system and the origin of
life on earth.
And in November the world watched with excitement
as NASA’s InSight lander successfully touched down on
the surface of Mars where its scientific instruments
will be used to take the first-ever in-depth look at the
planet’s interior. This was the fourth time a Lockheed
Martin-built lander successfully touched down on the
Red Planet. 
V 2018 Annual Report
EMBRACING THE INNOVATION
IMPERATIVE
At Lockheed Martin we view innovation as the lifeblood
of our corporation – and the key to our future success.
In 2018 we strengthened this commitment by using our
outstanding financial performance and the savings from
corporate tax reform to invest in the newest technology
the latest ventures and the talent that makes us
exceptional.
Our capital expenditures of 1.3 billion and our
independent research and development spending of
1.3 billion were both at record levels in 2018. We
are taking bold steps to strengthen our leadership in
innovative areas such as hypersonics laser weapons
systems autonomy and artificial intelligence.
For instance Lockheed Martin’s leadership in hypersonic
technology was further solidified in April when the U.S.
Air Force awarded our corporation a contract worth up
to 928 million to develop a Hypersonic Conventional
Strike Weapon – a new air-launched missile that will
travel more than five times faster than the speed
of sound to overcome enemy defenses. While the
development program will be led by our Space business
area the team includes experts from across the company
and fully leverages our broad portfolio to provide our
customer with this critical capability.
At Missiles and Fire Control we are also working
to design a second hypersonic weapon prototype
for the U.S. Air Force. Under a contract for up to
480 million we will provide the Air Force with the
critical design review test and production readiness
support for the new Air-Launched Rapid Response
Weapon.
At Rotary and Mission Systems we contracted with the
U.S. Navy to develop manufacture and deliver highpower laser weapon systems for the HELIOS program
(High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and
Surveillance). Lockheed Martin will help the Navy take
a major step forward in its goal to field laser weapon
systems aboard surface ships by 2021.
And our Skunk Works® division at Aeronautics marked
75 years of pioneering the future. In 2018 the Skunk
Works team celebrated multiple contract wins –
including one from NASA to design build and test a
full-scale supersonic technology demonstrator the
X-59 QueSST designed to quiet the sonic boom. The
X-plane will be used to help establish an acceptable
noise standard that could make over-land supersonic
passenger air travel a reality.
THE CORE VALUES THAT
DRIVE US
From nearly every perspective 2018 was a year of
outstanding performance by our company.
Our successes across the corporation flow from the
talent of our approximately 105000 men and women
around the world their sense of mission and their
commitment to uphold our core values to do what’s
right respect others and perform with excellence.
As we look to the future we can see tremendous need
for the products and systems Lockheed Martin provides
in every domain – on land at sea in the air in space
and in the cyber realm.
We can also be confident that as threats and challenges
evolve the people and innovations of Lockheed Martin
will help ensure our customers are well-positioned to
meet them. Together we have proven we can protect
life advance scientific discovery and deliver the safety
and security that enable progress for all.

We are pleased to report that 2018 was another strong year for Pfizer. We significantly advanced our pipeline delivered solid financial results enhanced shareholder value and took important steps to position the company for what we expect to be an era of sustained top- and bottom-line growth beginning in 2021 following the impact of Lyrica's upcoming patent expiration in the U.S.

In 2018 revenues increased 2 percent as several of our biggest-selling medicines and vaccines continued to grow including Ibrance Eliquis Xeljanz and Prevnar 13. We also generated growth in emerging markets and in biosimilars. The growth that we achieved in these areas helped to absorb 1.7 billion in lost revenue because of products that recently lost marketing exclusivity (LOE). We achieved these results while simultaneously investing 8 billion in research and development (R&D) and returning 20.2 billion directly to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in 2018.

Patient Impact
At Pfizer we take great pride in our financial performance because we know what is behind the numbers: our ability to have a demonstrable positive impact on patients. In 2018 we estimate that more than 784 million people around the world used our medicines and vaccines to improve their health making us one of the most significant contributors of good to humanity.

We're not stopping there. To reach even more patients we need to continue to deliver breakthrough medicines and in 2018 we made significant progress toward doing just that. Our R&D pipeline which is now stronger than it has ever been began yielding important new products including four targeted cancer agents approved in the last four months of the year. Overall we received seven key approvals during the year spanning both brand new molecular entities and new indications allowing us to serve a broader patient population.

Preparing for Sustained Growth
After prolonged periods of revenue decline due to significant LOE impacts - and then stability as we began to launch new products - we believe three intersecting factors will create significant opportunities for Pfizer to grow in the years ahead.

 Macro trends such as an aging population and a rising middle class in emerging markets will result in an increased number of people seeking access to both innovative and established medicines.
 We see the potential to launch up to 3-5 new products or product line extensions per year over the next five years.
 We expect to enjoy the benefits of a dramatic abatement in LOEs until the second half of the next decade after Lyrica loses its marketing exclusivity.
In 2018 we took several actions to prepare Pfizer to capitalize on these opportunities.

In July we announced that we were reorganizing the company into three businesses to better capitalize on the evolving and unique dynamics of their individual markets. The three businesses which became effective at the beginning of the company's 2019 fiscal year are Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group a science-based innovative medicines business that now includes biosimilars and a new Hospital business unit for anti-infectives and sterile injectables; Upjohn an off-patent branded and generic medicines business based in China that is bringing 20 of our most iconic brands to more than 100 markets around the world; and a Consumer Healthcare business aligned with the growing trend of consumers taking their health into their own hands. To further unlock value for our shareholders and to allow Pfizer to sharpen its focus on its pharmaceuticals business we signed an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to form a Consumer Healthcare joint venture. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions including GSK shareholder approval and required regulatory approvals.

Creating Shareholder Value

As we reorganized our businesses we also simplified our structure and processes including initiating a major digital effort to automate and improve operational effectiveness. These efforts also are freeing up capital that can be reinvested - primarily in scientific and commercial innovation but also in other key growth drivers including business development and manufacturing.

Our focus for business development initiatives continues to be smaller acquisition and licensing opportunities for mid-stage compounds. Pfizer has the financial flexibility to pursue these initiatives as we simultaneously deploy capital in other areas including shareholder-friendly capital allocation initiatives such as share repurchases. A growing dividend also remains an important part of our investment thesis.

Of course our business isn't without its challenges. Most significantly we need to ensure that our innovation and risk-taking are rewarded in the marketplace while doing all we can to ensure affordable access for patients. We continue to work with governments policymakers payers and other players in the healthcare ecosystem to advocate for pro-innovation policies that benefit patients our company and our industry as a whole.

Being a Responsible Corporate Citizen

Purpose-Driven Growth
We firmly believe that the biopharmaceutical companies that create meaningful value for patients over the next decade are the ones that will thrive. That's why we are putting a renewed emphasis on Pfizer's purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients' lives. Our purpose defines who we are as a company and serves as a focal point of our culture driving everything we do and energizing our more than 90000 colleagues.

When we talk about breakthroughs we are not talking about just big scientific breakthroughs but also breakthroughs in the way we work the way we interact with payers and policymakers and the way we provide access to patients. Taken together we believe these breakthroughs will create value for patients colleagues and shareholders.

Thank you for your continued support of the work we do every day.

The opportunity to lead Goldman Sachs is extraordinarily humbling and exciting made even more so as this year is the firm’s 150th anniversary. Like each of my predecessors my responsibility is to preserve the legacy of Goldman Sachs while remaining open to the change and innovation that best meet the needs of our clients.

I am privileged to be surrounded by exceptionally talented people at all levels of our firm including John Waldron our President and Chief Operating Officer and Stephen Scherr our Chief Financial Officer who are also intensely focused on ensuring that clients are at the center of everything we do — and in doing so creating long-term value for our shareholders.

While much has changed over the course of our 150-year history teamwork integrity adaptability and client service remain at the core of our culture.

The strength of our culture and client franchise was at the heart of our financial performance in 2018. We achieved record diluted earnings per common share and attained our highest annual return on average common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity since 2009. Net revenues of 36.62 billion and pre-tax earnings of 12.48 billion were both 12 percent higher compared with 2017 and the highest since 2010. Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share increased by 15 percent during the year to 207.36 and 196.64 respectively.


2018 Financial Performance 
 



Our Strategy
 
This performance alongside our strong levels of capital and liquidity put Goldman Sachs on a solid foundation. As we look ahead our focus is on delivering sustainable long-term returns for our shareholders through a strategy that revolves around our clients.

Our strategy comprises three core priorities:

• Growing and strengthening our existing businesses by deepening our relationships with existing clients and expanding our capabilities to serve new clients;

• Diversifying our business mix by increasing our fee-based or more recurring revenues including by launching new products and services; and

• Achieving greater operating efficiency across all areas of the firm including expenses funding costs and capital without compromising the long-standing strength of our control and risk management functions.

Our strategy reflects the need to anticipate and adapt to the structural forces that shape economies and industries and how our clients operate within them. Markets financial instruments and products and different client segments are converging and competing with one another at an unprecedented pace.

This requires us to simultaneously invest for growth and to create better efficiencies in the way we run certain businesses. I have advised companies for over three decades and the ones I have admired most are those that have managed their resources to allow for both investment and shareholder return. This is particularly critical when you consider how technology is influencing the way institutions and consumers alike are transacting in various markets and products including in our industry.

In that context across a number of our businesses particularly our market-making businesses we have to achieve the scale necessary to execute transactions in the most effective way for our clients. That means investing in platforms and empowering those who build them. It means encouraging the innovative ideas of our people that take good products and make them great. And it means looking at the revenues and expenses of businesses “front-to-back” so that we have a clear-eyed view of where technology investments the allocation of capital and other resources will be most critical to best delivering our advice execution and risk management to our clients.

Since last fall we have undertaken a review of each of our major businesses and the core activities within them. Each review has reinforced the fact that we benefit enormously from a strong client franchise around the world. At the same time we see tremendous opportunities to expand our addressable market and grow new businesses. As we pursue these opportunities our focus on strong risk management and controls will be central to our ability to meet the expectations of our clients and our shareholders.

Over the course of the year I look forward to communicating more details on our strategic direction and priorities which will include sharing certain financial metrics and targets to which my colleagues and I will be held accountable. I feel a sense of urgency and excitement about the opportunities we have identified but it is also important to be diligent and deliberate and not rush into long-term decision making.

While not exhaustive I want to spend the bulk of this letter providing you with a sense of the opportunities and priorities we will be focused on in the months and years ahead.

 

 

Grow and Strengthen Our Existing Businesses
 
Our first strategic priority is to expand our existing businesses and we are executing on a variety of growth initiatives to that end.

In Investment Banking for example we have embarked on a broad footprint expansion strategy that includes hiring new senior bankers adding coverage for more than 1000 new companies and creating opportunities to help more clients access equity capital and debt financing. As of year end we have made significant progress having assigned coverage on approximately 95 percent of our targeted universe of new clients across the Americas and EMEA.

Across FICC and Equities we have strong institutional wallet share which has improved by 65 and 110 basis points respectively since 2016.1 When I talk with many of our clients it is clear that they value FICC’s deep risk intermediation capabilities and expertise. In addition to that focus we continue to leverage platforms that integrate execution analytics and content for our clients. In Equities we are growing our electronic execution business through the development of low-touch platforms. And we are working with more corporate clients in EMEA and Asia particularly as it relates to our ability to deliver risk management solutions to them.

Over the past five years Investment Management has generated organic long-term fee-based net inflows of approximately 215 billion. We see further potential in this business by growing our advisory and outsourced CIO services as well as by expanding our product offering — notably our Alternatives platform and ETFs. We are also expanding our world-class private wealth management business by adding new private wealth advisors and increasing our collateralized lending to clients.

Within Investing & Lending our Merchant Banking business comprises a diversified portfolio across Corporate Private Equity and global Real Estate that is managed by hundreds of investment professionals and led by tenured senior leadership. Our strong track record built over the course of several decades positions us well to provide clients with additional attractive investing opportunities.

These various initiatives to strengthen and grow our existing businesses will be underscored by an emphasis on delivering the full value of One Goldman Sachs to our clients. An increasing number of institutions and companies interact with different parts of our firm. They don’t view their relationship with Goldman Sachs through the prism of a product or division. Historically we have tended to manage our client relationships through more of a divisional lens which can sometimes limit a more holistic view of how best to identify and meet the needs of these clients who are global complex and multifaceted.

One of my first priorities as CEO has been to ensure that the full range of our services and skill set is more accessible comprehensive and efficiently delivered. In that vein we have formed a cross-divisional client initiative led by senior leaders in our Institutional Client Services Investment Management and Investment Banking businesses to work with a pilot group of clients with multidimensional business needs.

Even at this early stage I am encouraged by the feedback from our clients and what we have learned from them. Over time we plan to expand this initiative to a broader group of clients with the simple goal of ensuring that we are orienting our client coverage around what is most important to our clients regardless of division or product area focus.


Diversify Our Business Mix with New Products and Services
 
A second element of our strategy is a focus on more durable revenues through lending and deposit activities cash management and wealth management. We have made considerable progress over the past five years but there is more we can do in the years ahead.

In 2016 we established Marcus: by Goldman Sachs our digital consumer financial services business. We are working to connect our growing customer base — and their growing wealth — to our broader suite of services as we develop a multitiered digital wealth management offering. Over time we expect this will grow to be another core capability of our client-centric multiproduct Marcus platform.

We are pleased with our early progress: we have more than 3 million total customers 36 billion in consumer deposits in the U.S. and the U.K. and nearly 5 billion of consumer loans. We are cognizant of the risk profile of our nascent consumer lending business and will remain attentive to where we are in the cycle as we grow our business for the long term.

We are also developing a dynamic digital cash management and payments platform for corporate clients. And the potential for Goldman Sachs in this space is significant. The industry cash management wallet is larger than the global investment banking wallet we compete for today.

As the leading M&A advisor globally companies already trust us to provide advice on their most significant transactions. We will build on these strong relationships and forge new ones by delivering new solutions that solve customer frustrations around outdated technology and limited customization and analytics.

We see a real opportunity to provide clients with a modern global cash management platform that is both secure and flexible. We expect this business to be accretive to our return profile and to provide a number of benefits to adjacent businesses including growing deposits and generating more client flows for our currencies franchise.

We are making tangible progress in building this platform and I expect that we will launch a cash management offering to clients next year.


Achieve Greater Operating Efficiency
 
Our third strategic priority is to ensure we are maximizing operating efficiency by investing in automation and technology that will improve the client experience and drive expense savings across our businesses.

For instance in FICC we are a top-2 institutional provider and gained share in six of eight asset classes in 20182 but the opportunity set and the global FICC wallet has declined significantly over the past decade. To adapt we have made important improvements in FICC’s efficiency reducing standardized risk-weighted assets by 40 percent and expenses by more than 20 percent each compared to 2013. FICC will continue to be a valuable offering for our clients and we see attractive opportunities to build scale within FICC as the market structure continues to evolve. Part of building scale is through improving the client experience and that means operating more efficiently.

Positioning ourselves for growth across our businesses partially entails funding investments from realized operating leverage in our core businesses. To help enforce this we are looking at our costs holistically and have improved our firmwide efficiency ratio to 64 percent in 2018 down nearly 2 percentage points over the past two years.

We also are identifying ways to manage our balance sheet more efficiently. We have identified deposits as a strategic focus to diversify our funding mix and lower our funding costs and have grown our deposit base by 34 billion over the past two years to 158 billion at the end of 2018.


A Culture of Risk Management
 
As we grow and expand our business reach bringing Goldman Sachs to more clients and customers we are dedicated to maintaining the primacy of the control function at the firm and upholding the highest standards in risk and operational management.

There are always important lessons to be learned from difficult situations and as it relates to 1MDB we have looked back and will continue to reflect on anything else the firm could have done better. It remains a priority for me that our culture of integrity compliance and escalation only improves from this experience.

Effective risk management is demanding and difficult. It requires constant vigilance and we won’t always get it right. But an unwavering cultural commitment to it lies at the heart of an effective financial institution and we believe it is a core competence that helps define Goldman Sachs.


Our People
 
I have been fortunate to have worked closely with Lloyd Blankfein over the years who stepped down as Chairman and CEO last year. Throughout his 36 years of dedicated service to the firm his keen understanding of markets and risk have been invaluable to keeping the firm both nimble and resolute in the face of constant change. And amidst the most turbulent days of the global financial crisis it was Lloyd’s fortitude and leadership that steadily navigated Goldman Sachs and its people through one of the most difficult episodes in our history. He has been a valued partner and colleague and I am grateful for his mentorship judgment and counsel.

In my travels and time with clients one refrain I hear time and again is that Goldman Sachs is different because of the quality of our people. Our success in delivering for our clients and on our strategic priorities depends on attracting retaining and developing talented people. Professionals want to be constantly learning working on important problems that have broad significance to industries economies and society and to be surrounded by diverse colleagues.

In my short time as CEO I’ve been vocal about the importance of advancing our firm’s diversity including with respect to gender race sexual orientation disability or whatever contributes to who we are. Effectively serving a broad and diverse set of clients means having an appreciation and understanding of their different experiences interests and values and we are committed to building a team capable of that critical work. Over the years the firm’s diversity and inclusion efforts have evolved from raising broader awareness and delivering an array of programs to a more deliberate data-driven and targeted strategy.

We have made progress in recent years and have more diverse representation on our Board of Directors. In addition our most recent partner class had the highest percentage of women and black partners in our history and we are nearly there on the campus analyst hiring goals we established last year. But we have a longer path ahead of us as it relates to our broader diversity ambitions. We are working with our Global Diversity Committee to advance specific goals and objectives. We are undertaking new initiatives aimed at increasing the representation of diverse communities at all levels across the firm. This includes increasing the representation of our analyst and entry-level associate new joiners — which represents more than 70 percent of our annual hiring — to 50 percent women 11 percent black professionals and 14 percent Hispanic/Latino professionals in the Americas and 9 percent black professionals in the U.K.

Fundamental change takes time but if we’re rigorous in our execution of incremental change we will make it happen. We simply do not have a choice but to strive to be one of the most diverse and inclusive institutions in the world. If we are not creative and do not take the right measures to embed a more diverse workforce across every facet of diversity we put in jeopardy our relevance to our clients and the markets we serve.



 

Sustainability
 
Managing the firm responsibly is core to our goal of driving superior long-term shareholder returns. We cannot be successful over the long term for our investors unless we think broadly about the impact we have on society and our communities — and then orient ourselves toward ways we can allocate capital purposefully.

A dedication to service and a commitment to using our expertise and convening power to help address broader issues has long been a core element of our culture. Over the course of many years we have developed innovative and meaningful philanthropic programs that have improved business education and provided access to capital for thousands of women entrepreneurs and small businesses.

Since the launch of our 10000 Women initiative in 2008 we have invested over 150 million to help women entrepreneurs across 56 countries providing practical business education mentoring networking and access to capital. Most recently we have democratized access to business education on a global scale through the introduction of online business education courses. In addition this past year the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility — developed in partnership with the IFC as the first of its kind gender facility — surpassed 1 billion in investments to financial institutions in 31 countries and is well on its way to providing capital to 100000 women.

Through our 10000 Small Businesses program launched in 2010 we have committed 500 million to provide training and access to capital to small business owners looking to grow and create new jobs in their communities with compelling results. To date we have graduated 8200 small business owners with 78 percent of graduates reporting revenue increases and 57 percent adding jobs within 30 months of graduation.

We will continue our commitment to these extraordinary programs but we see an increasing opportunity to focus on some of the other important issues that are facing society today — from the environment to health care to urban development.

For example our Urban Investment Group (UIG) has been a major investor in community development projects committing more than 7 billion in underserved American markets since 2001. In 2018 UIG continued its long-term support of the Brooklyn Navy Yard by committing 35 million to renovate Building 127 a 95000-square-foot manufacturing center that will drive the creation of approximately 300 quality urban manufacturing jobs.

Last year we announced Launch With GS a 500 million initiative to invest in women-led companies and investment managers. Through this effort we are harnessing our deep investment expertise to narrow the gender investing gap in three ways: committing firm capital in women-founded owned or led businesses directing client capital to invest in women-centered investing firms and creating an ecosystem to help build future investment opportunities.

More broadly we have seen fast-paced growth in our Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) and impact investing platform which reached 17 billion in assets under supervision at the end of 2018. This includes the launch of an ESG-focused ETF that provides our clients with broad exposure to U.S. large cap companies that rank favorably based on values identified by the American public.

And as another example at the end of 2018 we reached 80 billion in our goal to finance or invest 150 billion in clean energy by 2025.

We are a financial institution operating in global markets with a global client base — and we have a real opportunity through that work not only to lead by example in how we run our organization but to drive sustainable outcomes for our clients and for our communities.


Looking Ahead
 
Goldman Sachs of 2018 looks very different from the firm Marcus Goldman started a century and a half ago. Frankly it looks different from when I started here nearly 20 years ago. One of the reasons that Goldman Sachs has succeeded for so long is that it reflects individuals who have been able to adapt with the changing times — from market professionals who see how the emergence of new technologies will create new price setting mechanisms to control-side professionals who react quickly to financial and regulatory changes in an effort to always maintain the firm’s risk profile and operational integrity.

What initially attracted me to Goldman Sachs and what has kept me here over the years is our time-honored culture that values teamwork excellence and problem-solving; it has allowed us not only to survive but thrive in an industry that is cyclical by nature.

As we look to the future we are building new businesses and reorienting the firm for a broader set of opportunities. We have a robust approach to risk management and a strong balance sheet with the talent to deploy and protect it. We are investing across our businesses to serve new and existing clients and build upon an extraordinary client franchise. That’s why I am very confident of Goldman Sachs’ ability to generate strong industry-leading returns through the cycle.

The opportunity to lead Goldman Sachs is extraordinarily humbling and exciting made even more so as this year is the firm’s 150th anniversary. Like each of my predecessors my responsibility is to preserve the legacy of Goldman Sachs while remaining open to the change and innovation that best meet the needs of our clients.

I am privileged to be surrounded by exceptionally talented people at all levels of our firm including John Waldron our President and Chief Operating Officer and Stephen Scherr our Chief Financial Officer who are also intensely focused on ensuring that clients are at the center of everything we do — and in doing so creating long-term value for our shareholders.

While much has changed over the course of our 150-year history teamwork integrity adaptability and client service remain at the core of our culture.

The strength of our culture and client franchise was at the heart of our financial performance in 2018. We achieved record diluted earnings per common share and attained our highest annual return on average common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity since 2009. Net revenues of 36.62 billion and pre-tax earnings of 12.48 billion were both 12 percent higher compared with 2017 and the highest since 2010. Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share increased by 15 percent during the year to 207.36 and 196.64 respectively.


2018 Financial Performance 
 



Our Strategy
 
This performance alongside our strong levels of capital and liquidity put Goldman Sachs on a solid foundation. As we look ahead our focus is on delivering sustainable long-term returns for our shareholders through a strategy that revolves around our clients.

Our strategy comprises three core priorities:

• Growing and strengthening our existing businesses by deepening our relationships with existing clients and expanding our capabilities to serve new clients;

• Diversifying our business mix by increasing our fee-based or more recurring revenues including by launching new products and services; and

• Achieving greater operating efficiency across all areas of the firm including expenses funding costs and capital without compromising the long-standing strength of our control and risk management functions.

Our strategy reflects the need to anticipate and adapt to the structural forces that shape economies and industries and how our clients operate within them. Markets financial instruments and products and different client segments are converging and competing with one another at an unprecedented pace.

This requires us to simultaneously invest for growth and to create better efficiencies in the way we run certain businesses. I have advised companies for over three decades and the ones I have admired most are those that have managed their resources to allow for both investment and shareholder return. This is particularly critical when you consider how technology is influencing the way institutions and consumers alike are transacting in various markets and products including in our industry.

In that context across a number of our businesses particularly our market-making businesses we have to achieve the scale necessary to execute transactions in the most effective way for our clients. That means investing in platforms and empowering those who build them. It means encouraging the innovative ideas of our people that take good products and make them great. And it means looking at the revenues and expenses of businesses “front-to-back” so that we have a clear-eyed view of where technology investments the allocation of capital and other resources will be most critical to best delivering our advice execution and risk management to our clients.

Since last fall we have undertaken a review of each of our major businesses and the core activities within them. Each review has reinforced the fact that we benefit enormously from a strong client franchise around the world. At the same time we see tremendous opportunities to expand our addressable market and grow new businesses. As we pursue these opportunities our focus on strong risk management and controls will be central to our ability to meet the expectations of our clients and our shareholders.

Over the course of the year I look forward to communicating more details on our strategic direction and priorities which will include sharing certain financial metrics and targets to which my colleagues and I will be held accountable. I feel a sense of urgency and excitement about the opportunities we have identified but it is also important to be diligent and deliberate and not rush into long-term decision making.

While not exhaustive I want to spend the bulk of this letter providing you with a sense of the opportunities and priorities we will be focused on in the months and years ahead.

 

 

Grow and Strengthen Our Existing Businesses
 
Our first strategic priority is to expand our existing businesses and we are executing on a variety of growth initiatives to that end.

In Investment Banking for example we have embarked on a broad footprint expansion strategy that includes hiring new senior bankers adding coverage for more than 1000 new companies and creating opportunities to help more clients access equity capital and debt financing. As of year end we have made significant progress having assigned coverage on approximately 95 percent of our targeted universe of new clients across the Americas and EMEA.

Across FICC and Equities we have strong institutional wallet share which has improved by 65 and 110 basis points respectively since 2016.1 When I talk with many of our clients it is clear that they value FICC’s deep risk intermediation capabilities and expertise. In addition to that focus we continue to leverage platforms that integrate execution analytics and content for our clients. In Equities we are growing our electronic execution business through the development of low-touch platforms. And we are working with more corporate clients in EMEA and Asia particularly as it relates to our ability to deliver risk management solutions to them.

Over the past five years Investment Management has generated organic long-term fee-based net inflows of approximately 215 billion. We see further potential in this business by growing our advisory and outsourced CIO services as well as by expanding our product offering — notably our Alternatives platform and ETFs. We are also expanding our world-class private wealth management business by adding new private wealth advisors and increasing our collateralized lending to clients.

Within Investing & Lending our Merchant Banking business comprises a diversified portfolio across Corporate Private Equity and global Real Estate that is managed by hundreds of investment professionals and led by tenured senior leadership. Our strong track record built over the course of several decades positions us well to provide clients with additional attractive investing opportunities.

These various initiatives to strengthen and grow our existing businesses will be underscored by an emphasis on delivering the full value of One Goldman Sachs to our clients. An increasing number of institutions and companies interact with different parts of our firm. They don’t view their relationship with Goldman Sachs through the prism of a product or division. Historically we have tended to manage our client relationships through more of a divisional lens which can sometimes limit a more holistic view of how best to identify and meet the needs of these clients who are global complex and multifaceted.

One of my first priorities as CEO has been to ensure that the full range of our services and skill set is more accessible comprehensive and efficiently delivered. In that vein we have formed a cross-divisional client initiative led by senior leaders in our Institutional Client Services Investment Management and Investment Banking businesses to work with a pilot group of clients with multidimensional business needs.

Even at this early stage I am encouraged by the feedback from our clients and what we have learned from them. Over time we plan to expand this initiative to a broader group of clients with the simple goal of ensuring that we are orienting our client coverage around what is most important to our clients regardless of division or product area focus.


Diversify Our Business Mix with New Products and Services
 
A second element of our strategy is a focus on more durable revenues through lending and deposit activities cash management and wealth management. We have made considerable progress over the past five years but there is more we can do in the years ahead.

In 2016 we established Marcus: by Goldman Sachs our digital consumer financial services business. We are working to connect our growing customer base — and their growing wealth — to our broader suite of services as we develop a multitiered digital wealth management offering. Over time we expect this will grow to be another core capability of our client-centric multiproduct Marcus platform.

We are pleased with our early progress: we have more than 3 million total customers 36 billion in consumer deposits in the U.S. and the U.K. and nearly 5 billion of consumer loans. We are cognizant of the risk profile of our nascent consumer lending business and will remain attentive to where we are in the cycle as we grow our business for the long term.

We are also developing a dynamic digital cash management and payments platform for corporate clients. And the potential for Goldman Sachs in this space is significant. The industry cash management wallet is larger than the global investment banking wallet we compete for today.

As the leading M&A advisor globally companies already trust us to provide advice on their most significant transactions. We will build on these strong relationships and forge new ones by delivering new solutions that solve customer frustrations around outdated technology and limited customization and analytics.

We see a real opportunity to provide clients with a modern global cash management platform that is both secure and flexible. We expect this business to be accretive to our return profile and to provide a number of benefits to adjacent businesses including growing deposits and generating more client flows for our currencies franchise.

We are making tangible progress in building this platform and I expect that we will launch a cash management offering to clients next year.


Achieve Greater Operating Efficiency
 
Our third strategic priority is to ensure we are maximizing operating efficiency by investing in automation and technology that will improve the client experience and drive expense savings across our businesses.

For instance in FICC we are a top-2 institutional provider and gained share in six of eight asset classes in 20182 but the opportunity set and the global FICC wallet has declined significantly over the past decade. To adapt we have made important improvements in FICC’s efficiency reducing standardized risk-weighted assets by 40 percent and expenses by more than 20 percent each compared to 2013. FICC will continue to be a valuable offering for our clients and we see attractive opportunities to build scale within FICC as the market structure continues to evolve. Part of building scale is through improving the client experience and that means operating more efficiently.

Positioning ourselves for growth across our businesses partially entails funding investments from realized operating leverage in our core businesses. To help enforce this we are looking at our costs holistically and have improved our firmwide efficiency ratio to 64 percent in 2018 down nearly 2 percentage points over the past two years.

We also are identifying ways to manage our balance sheet more efficiently. We have identified deposits as a strategic focus to diversify our funding mix and lower our funding costs and have grown our deposit base by 34 billion over the past two years to 158 billion at the end of 2018.


A Culture of Risk Management
 
As we grow and expand our business reach bringing Goldman Sachs to more clients and customers we are dedicated to maintaining the primacy of the control function at the firm and upholding the highest standards in risk and operational management.

There are always important lessons to be learned from difficult situations and as it relates to 1MDB we have looked back and will continue to reflect on anything else the firm could have done better. It remains a priority for me that our culture of integrity compliance and escalation only improves from this experience.

Effective risk management is demanding and difficult. It requires constant vigilance and we won’t always get it right. But an unwavering cultural commitment to it lies at the heart of an effective financial institution and we believe it is a core competence that helps define Goldman Sachs.


Our People
 
I have been fortunate to have worked closely with Lloyd Blankfein over the years who stepped down as Chairman and CEO last year. Throughout his 36 years of dedicated service to the firm his keen understanding of markets and risk have been invaluable to keeping the firm both nimble and resolute in the face of constant change. And amidst the most turbulent days of the global financial crisis it was Lloyd’s fortitude and leadership that steadily navigated Goldman Sachs and its people through one of the most difficult episodes in our history. He has been a valued partner and colleague and I am grateful for his mentorship judgment and counsel.

In my travels and time with clients one refrain I hear time and again is that Goldman Sachs is different because of the quality of our people. Our success in delivering for our clients and on our strategic priorities depends on attracting retaining and developing talented people. Professionals want to be constantly learning working on important problems that have broad significance to industries economies and society and to be surrounded by diverse colleagues.

In my short time as CEO I’ve been vocal about the importance of advancing our firm’s diversity including with respect to gender race sexual orientation disability or whatever contributes to who we are. Effectively serving a broad and diverse set of clients means having an appreciation and understanding of their different experiences interests and values and we are committed to building a team capable of that critical work. Over the years the firm’s diversity and inclusion efforts have evolved from raising broader awareness and delivering an array of programs to a more deliberate data-driven and targeted strategy.

We have made progress in recent years and have more diverse representation on our Board of Directors. In addition our most recent partner class had the highest percentage of women and black partners in our history and we are nearly there on the campus analyst hiring goals we established last year. But we have a longer path ahead of us as it relates to our broader diversity ambitions. We are working with our Global Diversity Committee to advance specific goals and objectives. We are undertaking new initiatives aimed at increasing the representation of diverse communities at all levels across the firm. This includes increasing the representation of our analyst and entry-level associate new joiners — which represents more than 70 percent of our annual hiring — to 50 percent women 11 percent black professionals and 14 percent Hispanic/Latino professionals in the Americas and 9 percent black professionals in the U.K.

Fundamental change takes time but if we’re rigorous in our execution of incremental change we will make it happen. We simply do not have a choice but to strive to be one of the most diverse and inclusive institutions in the world. If we are not creative and do not take the right measures to embed a more diverse workforce across every facet of diversity we put in jeopardy our relevance to our clients and the markets we serve.

We cannot be successful over the long term for our investors unless we think broadly about the impact we have on society and our communities — and then orient ourselves toward ways we can allocate capital purposefully.

Fiscal 2018 was a great year for Cisco.
As I look back I am incredibly proud of
the tremendous progress we have made.
We returned to growth while transforming
our business model we executed well
against our strategy and our innovation
pipeline has never been stronger. I could
not be more excited about our future.
Harnessing the power of connections
In today’s complex hyperconnected cloud
world agility security and speed are
critical. To thrive companies must be able
to understand and securely harness the
power of their connections find patterns
and intelligence in data and anticipate
and respond to shifting market conditions
and stakeholders’ needs. Our strategy
is aligned with the changing needs of
our customers. With our commitment
to providing a highly secure intelligent
platform for digital business Cisco is
firmly focused on being the most strategic
partner for our customers and helping
them succeed in today’s world.
The broad adoption of multicloud
environments is changing the way our
customers build and secure their IT
infrastructure and Cisco is at the center of
this transition. Our highly secure intelligent
platform provides a critically important
component: the ability to move workloads
seamlessly across public and private clouds
while ensuring that our customers’ security
policies are applied effectively. In fiscal
2018 we continued to innovate to manage
complexity deliver solutions and enable
applications for this environment. We
have also extended our broad partnership
ecosystem and have been working
closely with the major cloud providers.
We are simplifying how our customers
work by providing consistent experiences
in on-premises and public-cloud
environments for the development
deployment and management of
applications and we believe Cisco is
very well positioned to benefit from the
increasing adoption of multicloud.
This past year we have also seen incredible
momentum with our intent-based
networking platform. Our customers are
looking to have simplified automated
networks and Cisco is delivering
a fundamentally new closed-loop
system that is powered by intent and
informed by context constantly learning
and adapting. The 2014 launch of
our Application Centric Infrastructure
(Cisco ACI)—policy-based automation for
the data center—was our first step. We
then brought intent-based networking to
the access network with the launch of the
Cisco Catalyst 9000 series of switches
Software-Defined Access (SD-Access)
and DNA Center—a centralized management
dashboard. Our Catalyst 9000 series of
switches has become the fastest ramping
product in Cisco’s history—testament
we believe to its ability to future-proof
networks; to integrate automation security
and analytics; and to free up operating
expenses and resources for our customers.
We have now extended SD-Access
and DNA Center to the Internet of
Things (IoT) environment as well as
extended Cisco ACI to the public cloud
with Cisco ACI Anywhere. We have
closed the loop with the addition of
network assurance capabilities providing
continuous verification of the network’s
intent and offering insights and visibility
into network policy and actions. We intend
to extend open programmable access
across the entire network as we build
an ecosystem around our intent-based
networking portfolio.
Inevitably as connections multiply the
threat landscape continues to grow
and the concept of a security perimeter
disappears. Security is fundamental across
our portfolio and is foundational to all we
do at Cisco. Our strategy is to simplify
and increase security efficacy through an
architectural approach with products that
work together and share analytics and
actionable threat intelligence. We have
been working hard to build an end-to-end
security architecture from the endpoint
to the network to the cloud covering the
entire attack continuum.
Shortly after the end of fiscal 2018
we announced our intention to acquire
Duo Security to expand our cloud
security capabilities. Duo’s multifactor
authentication solution verifies the
identity of users and the health of their
devices before granting them access to
applications helping prevent cybersecurity
breaches. Duo’s relevance within the
context of our intent-based networking
strategy spans the entire extended
enterprise. Its portfolio of cloud-delivered
solutions will help enable what our
customers require in today’s multicloud
world: the ability to securely connect any
user on any device to any application on
any network.

2 Cisco 2018 Annual Report
With intent-based networking we have
not only changed the building blocks for
networks but have created a platform
for innovation across our entire portfolio.
In fiscal 2018 we introduced new
wide-area network (WAN) offerings
through the integration of Viptela’s
SD-WAN capabilities with our core
portfolio as well as new access and data
center offerings. With the integration of
AppDynamics we continued to develop
our analytics capabilities bringing
end-to-end visibility and analytics from the
end user to the network to the application.
We also introduced new developer
capabilities spanning all network domains
through our DevNet program.
We are dedicated to creating better
experiences for our customers and
employees and one way we do this is
through our collaboration portfolio. In
fiscal 2018 we created a new integrated
meetings experience with Cisco Webex
and added cloud calling and contact
center solutions through the acquisition
of Broadsoft and integration with Google.
With the acquisition of Accompany we are
adding more intelligence and contextual
information to meeting and team
collaboration experiences.
Cultivating success
Our relationships with our customers are
changing from transactional to lifecycle so
we have created a Customer Experience
organization to help ensure their success
at every stage of their digitization journey.
Our commitment to our customers’
success also drives our belief that it is
essential to have a diversity of experiences
and perspectives on our leadership team
to yield the best results.
We are committed not only to our
customers but also to making a difference
in the world and solving some of the
world’s greatest challenges. Two years
ago we set a goal to positively impact
one billion people by 2025 and every
day we come a step closer through our
focus on educating the workforce of the
future through the Cisco Networking
Academy building stronger communities
and applying our resources to the most
pressing societal issues.
Transforming our business model
As we integrate our products and services
into architectures we are selling more
software and subscription-based offerings.
These are designed to provide our
customers with flexibility and continuous
value and at the same time they help us to
shift our business model to more recurring
revenue streams.
In fiscal 2018 we delivered strong top-line
growth and profitability reporting our
highest-ever revenue of 49.3 billion.
Recurring offers accounted for 32% of
our total revenue in fiscal 2018 and
revenue from subscriptions was 54% of
our software revenue. Our intention is to
continue to drive recurring revenues by
applying a subscription-based model to
many of the new products we launch and
ultimately across our entire portfolio.
Our balance sheet remains strong and
we generated 13.7 billion in operating
cash flow in fiscal 2018. We returned
23.6 billion to shareholders comprising
6.0 billion of dividends and 17.7 billion
of share repurchases.
Capitalizing on our opportunities
Our solid performance in fiscal 2018
demonstrates a combination of strong
customer adoption of our latest solutions
the ongoing value customers see in our
software and subscription offerings and
excellent execution. Our customers are
looking for us to provide even greater
value to them by redesigning their IT
architecture; delivering security; and
building orchestrating and managing
applications. We are delivering solutions
that matter to our customers our strategy
is working and we believe we are well
positioned to capture growth across
our portfolio.
We are looking forward to fiscal 2019
with a clear focus on growth execution
and innovation. We will continue to drive
automation security and analytics across
the entire network infrastructure. We will
also leverage our assets and the power
of connections across our portfolio and
create an architecture designed to support
our customers’ success—all the way
from IoT to multicloud—in a way that only
Cisco can.
Thank you for your continued support.

its lowest-ever commercial pharmacy trend
of 0.4%.5 These successes were driven by
Express Scripts’ clinically based solutions
which help ensure appropriate use better
outcomes and greater affordability.
The greatest contributors to Cigna’s and Express
Scripts’ results were – and continue to be – our
combined company’s now 74000 colleagues
around the world who are dedicated to living
our mission and creating exceptional value each
and every day. I am proud of their continued
focus and passion.
Cigna is well positioned to deliver attractive
and sustainable growth in 2019 – as well as 15%

Cigna’s integrated suite of health services and
160 million customer and patient relationships in
more than 30 countries and jurisdictions gives
us unique visibility into what works in health care
systems – in the United States as well as around
the globe.
In the United States it remains clear that our
nation’s health care is on an unsustainable path.
The health of many people across the globe
continues to decline causing us to consume
more health care goods and services which
more often than not reimburse health care
providers for the quantity of services they
deliver rather than for the health outcomes of
the people in their care. Our spending continues
to rise at a level well above other industries.
On top of this keeping people healthy is
undervalued; too often consumers aren’t
incentivized enough to stay or get healthy.
Further significant gaps exist in how care is
accessed making this even harder for many
of our underserved populations.
Some argue this offers evidence that the United
States health care system “doesn’t work” and
would be better served by a greater reliance on
government-run health care analogous to what
we see in some other countries.
As a global health service company however
we see that many countries relying heavily
on government-run health care face similar
health and affordability challenges. For
example obesity rates more than doubled
over the past 40 years in France Turkey and
the United Kingdom.7 South Korea’s per capita
national health expenditure grew nearly 300%
between 2001 and 2015.8 In these and many
other countries people increasingly turn to
Cigna’s supplemental benefits to aug

Based on our insight into health care systems
worldwide Cigna strongly believes the best way
to generate further health care improvements
in the United States is through even greater
reliance on private market-driven solutions.
This is because we see the power and positive
impact that private market-driven solutions
already have on improving health and affordability
and in filling gaps in the health care system – both
on their own and working in concert with public
government solutions. The employer market
offers a strong example of this.
At Cigna we seek to leverage and fuel the best
of the private system’s innovation in partnership
with responsible and innovative public program
development.
Cigna believes that a stronger reliance on marketdriven solutions is essential to building a truly
sustainable health care system. These solutions
are responsible for many of the bright spots we
see in health care today.
Approximately two-thirds of all Americans
nearly 200 million people access health
coverage through employers either as a
benefit of their employment or a parent’s
or spouse’s employment.9
A healthy and productive employer market is
critical to the United States’ ability to compete
locally and globally and as such employers
are acutely aware of health care’s impact on
their employees’ productivity and success. By
encouraging greater personalization and bringing
together capabilities to drive affordability
employer engagement in the health of their
employees is beneficial to the United States
system at large.
Employers are uniquely qualified to create
localized programs focused on engaging
employees to take an active role in their health.
In 2015 21% of those in employer-based coverage
had incomes that would have qualified them
for cost-sharing subsidies on the exchanges
or Medicaid and 43% would have qualified for
premium subsidies or Medicaid.10 The cost shift
from Medicare and Medicaid to private payers
represents a financing dynamic on which the
United States delivery system largely relies to
provide needed care and even to extend the
financial viability of government programs.
Integrated and incentive-based programs
are driving increased innovation consumer
engagement and improved health outcomes.
Innovations driving the delivery system shift
from volume to value – or put differently
toward incentivizing health outcomes rather
than the quantity of services provided – began
in employer-provided coverage arrangements.
Every new year more and more employers are
focused on giving their employees access to
high-quality health care providers; consistent
access to acute chronic and preventive care;
health-engagement and coaching programs;
and incentives to encourage individuals to seek
the highest value in the

Cigna has been a leader in creating Accountable
Care Organization (ACO) programs for more than
10 years. These programs seek to provide better
overall health affordability and experience for
communities. Cigna has more than 600 of these
arrangements11 which incentivize providers to
deliver care based on patient health outcomes
not the volume of care they provide or number
of tests they run. Recently we announced that
we exceeded our value-based care goal of having
50% of our Medicare and commercial health care
provider payments through alternative payment
arrangements in Cigna’s top 40 markets by yearend 2018 – resulting in 600 million in medical
cost savings between 2013 and 2017.12
These efforts to align incentives are improving
quality and provider satisfaction too. Cigna’s topperforming accountable care program health care
providers demonstrated a quality performance of
11% better than the market13 with 92% of providers
either meeting or exceeding quality benchmarks.14
According to a survey15 of Cigna commercial
accountable care program providers:
> 92% say the insights and guidance
Cigna provides help them improve
performance and outcomes.
> 95% say their relationship with
Cigna is collaborative and consultative
rather than transactional.
> 95% say it is easy to do business
with Cigna.

Medicare Advantage programs are driving
superior outcomes compared with traditional
Medicare programs.
Medicare Advantage is a public-private
partnership offering Medicare-eligible Americans
personalized comprehensive and affordable
coverage. Today Medicare Advantage health
plans cost taxpayers the same as traditional
Medicare all while offering more benefits such
as vision dental and fitness plans as well as
transportation services.
The advantages of Medicare Advantage
plans relative to traditional Medicare plans
are numerous.
> A study funded by the National Institute
on Aging found that Medicare Advantage
enrollees are less likely to require post-acute
care following a hospital stay and are less
likely to be readmitted to a hospital than
beneficiaries in traditional Medicare.17
> Research shows that individuals with diabetes
enrolled in Medicare Advantage Chronic
Condition Special Needs Plans experienced
19% fewer hospital days per enrollee than
those in traditional Medicare plans.18
> A recent survey from the Better Medicare
Alliance found that 58% of seniors switching
from traditional Medicare to a Medicare
Advantage plan say their Medicare Advantage
plan is preferable compared with only 2%
who favored their traditional Medicare plan.19
The private sector is faster and more effective
than government-run programs at innovating
helping improve outcomes and increasing
affordability.
Consider Medicare Part D which provides a
prescription drug benefit to Medicare enrollees
with the Part D benefit administered by
commercial drug plans and Medicare Advantage
drug plans. The government didn’t launch it
until 2006 – 40 years after the introduction
of Medicare.
The vigorous negotiation which takes place
between pharmacy service organizations and
pharmacies as well as with manufacturers
has been confirmed by external researchers to
improve a variety of health outcomes while also
generating 6 in savings for each 1 spent on
their services.20
Further pharmacy service organizations are
expected to help prevent an estimated one
billion medication errors over the next decade.21
They will also improve drug therapy and patient
adherence among diabetes patients – preventing
approximately 480000 heart failures 230000
incidences of kidney disease 180000 strokes
and 8000 amputations annually; and help
reduce costs by 40%–50% for patients and
payers compared with what they would have
otherwise spent.22
While many rightfully point to drug pricing as
a challenge to health care affordability and
outcomes the overprescribing of drugs is
equally concerning. Prescription drugs are too
often the preferred first line of treatment for
many illnesses. As we have see

With the addition of Express Scripts’ pharmacy
services Cigna now provides an even more
comprehensive view of health care able to
“connect the dots” across a customer’s health
journey. Our data-driven insights combined with
our clinical expertise enable us to create uniquely
tailored interventions that more frequently
deliver the right amount of medicine to the right
customer at the right time. Our solutions address
both components of trend (utilization and cost)
and enable us to deliver health outcomes that
others cannot.

Cigna’s ongoing growth reflects our proven
approach to service integration and to delivering
real value for the benefit of our customers
patients clients and health care provider partners.
Cigna’s recent externally validated report on
the value of integration shows that clients with
Cigna medical pharmacy and behavioral benefits
reduce annual medical costs by an average of
645 for each person with an identified health
improvement opportunity – savings that can
increase to nearly 10000 for individuals with
certain chronic conditions.23
Our unique approach to integration focuses on
the coordination of services around the individual
and their whole person health needs – both body
and mind. This approach also further expands
choice so our customers and patients have
access to the health care they need anytime
anywhere based on their needs and preferences.

Cigna’s new advertising initiative uses the power
of influencers to spotlight the importance of
mental health as a key factor in overall health.
The campaign brings together Queen Latifah
Nick Jonas and Ted Danson to encourage everyone
to schedule their annual check-up and talk openly
and honestly with their health care providers about
how they are feeling physically and emotionally.

In an environment where some are restricting
access in order to narrowly drive affordability
Cigna sees an opportunity to further expand
customer choice and to make it easier for people
to access the health services they need whether
in a doctor’s office an urgent care center a
retail setting or employer clinic; or for more
acute needs at a hospital or outpatient service
center. In addition to these venues customers
increasingly choose to secure the health care
services they need at home or through digital
platforms. At Cigna we see this level of choice
as a tremendous opportunity.
Viewed from a pharmacy perspective Cigna
is focused on improving health outcomes and
reducing total costs by harnessing the breadth
and depth of our data to better predict and
identify conditions or behaviors and to improve
connectivity among our customers patients and
health care providers.
For example we now have more than 50000
patients with WiFi-enabled blood glucose
monitors that are sharing data related to their
blood sugars with their pharmacists every day.
When one of our dedicated pharmacists detects
an out-of-range blood sugar level they reach out
to the patient immediately with an intervention
tailored to that patient’s needs. Over time we’ve
seen meaningfully improved outcomes including
a 4% increase in adherence to oral medication a
23% drop in hyperglycemic episodes a 42% drop
in extreme hyperglycemic episodes and a 36%
drop in extreme hypoglycemic episodes.24

For all of the private sector driven bright spots
discussed Cigna believes it’s equally important
for organizations to actively prioritize community
engagement to enable communities to fill health
gaps that the health care system alone cannot.
This was a major driving factor behind Cigna’s
2018 commitment to make an incremental
investment of 200 million in the Cigna
Foundation and our communities. As part of this
investment the Cigna Foundation committed
25 million for a new five-year community
engagement initiative focused on the well-being
of children around the world with the first year
committed to addressing food insecurities
through a program called Healthier Kids for
Our Future.25
In the United States Cigna was the first in
our industry to address the opioid epidemic –
partnering with physicians dentists and
community leaders to change overprescribing
patterns and helping to reduce prescribed
opioids to Cigna customers by 25% in less than
two years. Cigna recently expanded our goal
to reduce opioid overdoses by 25% among
our customers in targeted communities by
the end of 2021.26
Cigna views our role in driving change through
community leadership as a critical one and we
are excited to keep you updated on a variety of
new initiatives in 2019.
Cigna created an opioid pain plan campaign
responding to the issue that one in five people
are at increased risk of long-term opioid use –
and addiction – with only a 10-day prescription.
Cigna’s 1 in 5 Campaign included athletes chefs
and other social media influencers to help
educate providers and consumers before an
opioid prescription is written and guide providers
to offer resources on pain and suggest ways to
manage pain safely.

have positively impacted over those 50 years. Though much has changed in the field of healthcare since 1968 our founders’
vision remains the same: to provide the best patient care and service possible; to partner with physicians nurses and other
colleagues to achieve excellent outcomes; and to use the best of business to improve performance.
Our year of celebration was also a year of growth. Strategic investments in expanding our networks and clinical capabilities
continued to make it easier for patients to obtain high-quality convenient patient care. At the same time we took key steps
toward maintaining and growing the strength of our caregiver relationships laying the groundwork for a new enterprise brand
and completing a leadership transition that positions HCA Healthcare for continued growth and success going forward.
A Year of Growth
The year ended with our 19th
consecutive quarter of growth in
same-facility inpatient admissions.
HCA Healthcare generated revenues of
46.7 billion an increase of 7 percent
over 2017 with same-facility equivalent
admissions totaling 3.2 million. 2018 net
income attributable to HCA Healthcare
Inc. was 3.8 billion and earnings per
diluted share was 10.66. In addition
for the 10th consecutive year we
obtained Ethisphere Institute’s award
as a World’s Most Ethical Company.
In 2018 we also continued to reinvest in
our company and markets. We finished
the year investing 3.6 billion of capital
in the communities we serve and plan
to invest more this year. We have in
excess of 3.5 billion of capital projects
in the pipeline. This will strengthen our
existing healthcare services and create
additional inpatient and outpatient
capacity within our local healthcare
systems. We also returned value to our
shareholders completing 1.5 billion of
share repurchases in 2018 and initiating
a quarterly dividend.
This past year was also one of
expansion. In 2018 we agreed to
purchase Mission Health a six-hospital
system in Asheville and western North
Carolina for approximately 1.5 billion.
Recognized as one of the nation’s top
15 health systems by IBM Watson
Health in six of the past seven years
the system now operates as the newly
created North Carolina Division. The
proceeds of the sale which closed early
in 2019 were used to fund the nonprofit
Dogwood Health Trust whose purpose
is to improve the health and well-being
of the people and communities of
western North Carolina.
In addition to Mission Health we made
other acquisitions that enhanced our
networks including Memorial Health in
Savannah Georgia and North Cypress
Medical Center in Houston Texas.
To complement our acquisition strategy
we invested in the expansion of our care
settings to provide better access and
convenience by locating facilities closer
to where our patients live and work. At
year end we operated 179 hospitals
142 ambulatory and GI surgery centers
84 free-standing emergency rooms 130
urgent care centers and 1120 physician
clinics. This market-focused approach of
offering diverse sites of care is designed
to make it easier for our patients to
receive the healthcare services they
need when they need them.
Raising the Bar for Quality Patient Care
With HCA Healthcare’s growth and
scale comes great responsibility
to ensure we deliver high-quality
convenient care to our patients. Over
the past five years we have increased
the complexity of service offerings
within our networks.
As a learning health system our goal
is to identify best practices and make
them the standard of care across our
facilities. Repeatedly we have achieved
this goal and raised the bar for the
practice of medicine across service
lines including:
Stroke: At year end our median
stroke response time was 25
percent faster than the standard
national goal. With 26 accredited
comprehensive stroke centers
HCA Healthcare’s talented stroke
experts use proven clinical protocols
telemedicine and coordinated care
to provide timely state-of-the-art
service to our patients.
Trauma: HCA Healthcare is the
largest provider of trauma care and
burn care in the U.S. and we grew our
volume last year by six percent.
Sepsis: Sepsis is the body’s response
to overwhelming infection and the
U.S. has approximately 1.5 million
sepsis cases annually. To combat
sepsis in 2018 we completed an
enterprise-wide roll-out of SPOT
(Sepsis Prediction and Optimization
of Therapy) a predictive algorithm
and workflow we developed
based upon data from millions of
hospitalizations from our facilities.
Running 24/7 SPOT provides realtime decision support to physicians
and nurses to help detect sepsis
hours earlier and with greater
accuracy helping to save lives.
Bone marrow transplants: There
have been enormous advances
in transplantation for cancer
patients and Sarah Cannon the
Cancer Institute of HCA Healthcare
performs more transplants than
any other network. With 17 percent
growth in 2018 we now have
accredited programs in Austin
Dallas Denver Nashville New
Orleans and San Antonio and
plan to open two more this year in
Kansas City and Las Vegas.
Our approach which uses our vast
clinical data warehouse in partnership
with our physicians and other
caregivers consistently yields value for
our patients value for our communities
and value for our company.
Investing in Our People
Throughout our history our operational
and clinical successes would not have
been possible without the people of
HCA Healthcare. Today our 276000
dedicated employees including
94000 nurses and our 38000
affiliated physicians drive our patient
experience quality of care and operating
performance. Recognizing their intrinsic
value we are increasing our investments
in our nurses colleagues and physicians.
2018 was a landmark year for HCA Healthcare. We celebrated our company’s golden anniversary and the countless lives we
have positively impacted over those 50 years. Though much has changed in the field of healthcare since 1968 our founders’
vision remains the same: to provide the best patient care and service possible; to partner with physicians nurses and other
colleagues to achieve excellent outcomes; and to use the best of business to improve performance.

toward maintaining and growing the strength of our caregiver relationships laying the groundwork for a new enterprise brand
and completing a leadership transition that positions HCA Healthcare for continued growth and success going forward.
For HCA Healthcare 2018 marked great
strides in our nursing operations. Our
commitment to our nurses has resulted
in a positive impact on clinical outcomes
patient experience efficiency of care
and nurse engagement. Our efforts to
secure a robust pipeline of nurse leaders
have reduced chief nursing officer
vacancies and the time to fill these
critical positions. We also added more
than 6200 registered nurses in 2018 by
decreasing turnover and improving our
recruitment and selection processes.
We employed new technologies to
improve communication between
patients and nurses and across care
teams through advanced nurse call and
iMobile. In addition we completed the
deployment of a revised documentation
system that returned 30 minutes of
time to our nurses in each 12-hour shift
and generated data necessary to drive
improvement in clinical outcomes.
Finally we successfully completed
the pilot of a new approach to clinical
education that will support professional
development throughout our nurses’
careers and meet the needs of our
patient population.
Moving forward we will continue to
champion nursing initiatives that
enhance professional nursing practice and
improve patient safety clinical outcomes
and experience.
In 2018 HCA Healthcare also initiated an
investment of up to 300 million over
three years for programs that support
our colleagues’ career development their
families and their lives. Some programs are
already underway including new paid family
leave benefits tuition reimbursement
for most full- and part-time colleagues
student loan debt assistance expanded
certification offerings and plans for a
scholarship program for children of HCA
Healthcare colleagues.
For our physicians HCA Healthcare
continued investing in graduate medical
education (GME) programs which allow
medical school graduates to complete
training required for licensure and specialty
board certification at our facilities. We
started 39 new nationally accredited GME
programs in 2018 and now have more than
230 GME programs with total enrollment
of more than 3000 residents and 200
fellows last year. This makes our GME
program one of the largest providers of
residency and fellowship training across
the nation which better positions our
GME graduates to practice medicine at
the highest level oftentimes at an HCA
Healthcare hospital.

life. As part of that mission it is our
responsibility to care for each other our
patients and the communities we serve.
Our Purpose-Driven Future
As we look to the future and invest more
than ever in achieving our mission we
also believe it is time to tell our story
more broadly more consistently and
more succinctly. We want our colleagues
our physicians our payers and others to
understand more clearly our combined
purpose and the passion that drives
it. This is why we spent much of 2018
preparing to roll out a new purpose-driven
brand in 2019.
Our new brand does not mean that we
are going to change the names of our
facilities. What it will do is underscore and
support the reputation we have built in
the communities we serve.
Our enterprise brand will help explain
who we are as an organization and
define our common purpose: we exist
to give people a healthier tomorrow. It
will simplify our complexity assist with
recruitment and retention and most
importantly better define how we
collectively serve our patients.
We believe our outlook towards 2019
and beyond is compelling. Buoyed by
the differentiation of our scale and
capabilities we seek to be the provider
of choice for patients physicians and
payers in every community we serve.
The fundamentals in our markets are
strong with rising demand for healthcare
services and we are answering that
demand by expanding how and where we
deliver quality patient care. We believe
these factors will be a competitive
advantage and continue to provide
growth opportunities for us.
As of January 1 2019 we had a smooth
management transition with both of
us entering new roles after 36 years
with HCA Healthcare. We have worked
as a successful team for more than
two decades and understand the
responsibilities and accountability HCA
Healthcare has to our patients colleagues
physicians shareholders and communities.
In addition we are excited to welcome
Thomas F. Frist III as the next chairman
of the board of directors following our
annual meeting in April. The Frist family’s
long-term stewardship ownership
and continued involvement reinforce
our mission and values and serves the
company and all stakeholders well. As we
look to the future we are confident that
HCA Healthcare will continue its legacy as
a preeminent healthcare services provider. 
A Year of Growth
The year ended with our 19th
consecutive quarter of growth in
same-facility inpatient admissions.
HCA Healthcare generated revenues of
46.7 billion an increase of 7 percent
over 2017 with same-facility equivalent
admissions totaling 3.2 million. 2018 net
income attributable to HCA Healthcare
Inc. was 3.8 billion and earnings per
diluted share was 10.66. In addition
for the 10th consecutive year we
obtained Ethisphere Institute’s award
as a World’s Most Ethical Company.
In 2018 we also continued to reinvest in
our company and markets. We finished
the year investing 3.6 billion of capital
in the communities we serve and plan
to invest more this year. We have in
excess of 3.5 billion of capital projects
in the pipeline. This will strengthen our
existing healthcare services and create
additional inpatient and outpatient
capacity within our local healthcare
systems. We also returned value to our
shareholders completing 1.5 billion of
share repurchases in 2018 and initiating
a quarterly dividend.
This past year was also one of
expansion. In 2018 we agreed to
purchase Mission Health a six-hospital
system in Asheville and western North
Carolina for approximately 1.5 billion.
Recognized as one of the nation’s top
15 health systems by IBM Watson
Health in six of the past seven years
the system now operates as the newly
created North Carolina Division. The
proceeds of the sale which closed early
in 2019 were used to fund the nonprofit
Dogwood Health Trust whose purpose
is to improve the health and well-being
of the people and communities of
western North Carolina.
In addition to Mission Health we made
other acquisitions that enhanced our
networks including Memorial Health in
Savannah Georgia and North Cypress
Medical Center in Houston Texas.
To complement our acquisition strategy
we invested in the expansion of our care
settings to provide better access and
convenience by locating facilities closer
to where our patients live and work. At
year end we operated 179 hospitals
142 ambulatory and GI surgery centers
84 free-standing emergency rooms 130
urgent care centers and 1120 physician
clinics. This market-focused approach of
offering diverse sites of care is designed
to make it easier for our patients to
receive the healthcare services they
need when they need them.
Raising the Bar for Quality Patient Care
With HCA Healthcare’s growth and
scale comes great responsibility
to ensure we deliver high-quality
convenient care to our patients. Over
the past five years we have increased
the complexity of service offerings
within our networks.
As a learning health system our goal
is to identify best practices and make
them the standard of care across our
facilities. Repeatedly we have achieved
this goal and raised the bar for the
practice of medicine across service
lines including:
Stroke: At year end our median
stroke response time was 25
percent faster than the standard
national goal. With 26 accredited
comprehensive stroke centers
HCA Healthcare’s talented stroke
experts use proven clinical protocols
telemedicine and coordinated care
to provide timely state-of-the-art
service to our patients.
Trauma: HCA Healthcare is the
largest provider of trauma care and
burn care in the U.S. and we grew our
volume last year by six percent.
Sepsis: Sepsis is the body’s response
to overwhelming infection and the
U.S. has approximately 1.5 million
sepsis cases annually. To combat
sepsis in 2018 we completed an
enterprise-wide roll-out of SPOT
(Sepsis Prediction and Optimization
of Therapy) a predictive algorithm
and workflow we developed
based upon data from millions of
hospitalizations from our facilities.
Running 24/7 SPOT provides realtime decision support to physicians
and nurses to help detect sepsis
hours earlier and with greater
accuracy helping to save lives.
Bone marrow transplants: There
have been enormous advances
in transplantation for cancer
patients and Sarah Cannon the
Cancer Institute of HCA Healthcare
performs more transplants than
any other network. With 17 percent
growth in 2018 we now have
accredited programs in Austin
Dallas Denver Nashville New
Orleans and San Antonio and
plan to open two more this year in
Kansas City and Las Vegas.
Our approach which uses our vast
clinical data warehouse in partnership
with our physicians and other
caregivers consistently yields value for
our patients value for our communities
and value for our company.
Investing in Our People
Throughout our history our operational
and clinical successes would not have
been possible without the people of
HCA Healthcare. Today our 276000
dedicated employees including
94000 nurses and our 38000
affiliated physicians drive our patient
experience quality of care and operating
performance. Recognizing their intrinsic
value we are increasing our investments
in our nurses colleagues and physicians.
2018 was a landmark year for HCA Healthcare. We celebrated our company’s golden anniversary and the countless lives we
have positively impacted over those 50 years. Though much has changed in the field of healthcare since 1968 our founders’
vision remains the same: to provide the best patient care and service possible; to partner with physicians nurses and other
colleagues to achieve excellent outcomes; and to use the best of business to improve performance.
Our year of celebration was also a year of growth. Strategic investments in expanding our networks and clinical capabilities
continued to make it easier for patients to obtain high-quality convenient patient care. At the same time we took key steps
toward maintaining and growing the strength of our caregiver relationships laying the groundwork for a new enterprise brand
and completing a leadership transition that positions HCA Healthcare for continued growth and success going forward.
For HCA Healthcare 2018 marked great
strides in our nursing operations. Our
commitment to our nurses has resulted
in a positive impact on clinical outcomes
patient experience efficiency of care
and nurse engagement. Our efforts to
secure a robust pipeline of nurse leaders
have reduced chief nursing officer
vacancies and the time to fill these
critical positions. We also added more
than 6200 registered nurses in 2018 by
decreasing turnover and improving our
recruitment and selection processes.
We employed new technologies to
improve communication between
patients and nurses and across care
teams through advanced nurse call and
iMobile. In addition we completed the
deployment of a revised documentation
system that returned 30 minutes of
time to our nurses in each 12-hour shift
and generated data necessary to drive
improvement in clinical outcomes.
Finally we successfully completed
the pilot of a new approach to clinical
education that will support professional
development throughout our nurses’
careers and meet the needs of our
patient population.
Moving forward we will continue to
champion nursing initiatives that
enhance professional nursing practice and
improve patient safety clinical outcomes
and experience.
In 2018 HCA Healthcare also initiated an
investment of up to 300 million over
three years for programs that support
our colleagues’ career development their
families and their lives. Some programs are
already underway including new paid family
leave benefits tuition reimbursement
for most full- and part-time colleagues
student loan debt assistance expanded
certification offerings and plans for a
scholarship program for children of HCA
Healthcare colleagues.
For our physicians HCA Healthcare
continued investing in graduate medical
education (GME) programs which allow
medical school graduates to complete
training required for licensure and specialty
board certification at our facilities. We
started 39 new nationally accredited GME
programs in 2018 and now have more than
230 GME programs with total enrollment
of more than 3000 residents and 200
fellows last year. This makes our GME
program one of the largest providers of
residency and fellowship training across
the nation which better positions our
GME graduates to practice medicine at
the highest level oftentimes at an HCA
Healthcare hospital.

merger of American Airlines and US Airways.
With most of the integration work now behind
us and 25 billion invested in our team and
product our efforts are poised to pay off. We
made great strides in delivering a world-class
customer experience improving our revenue
performance and taking care of our team members.
At the same time 2018 presented challenges to our business as we faced
rising fuel prices difficult weather events uncertain economic conditions
in some parts of the world and the early stages of a government
shutdown at the end of the year. We did not meet all our targets for
operational performance which we know had an impact on customer
satisfaction.
But we are a team that collaborates adapts and continues to move
forward. We identified challenges and implemented action plans to
adjust and correct. By the end of 2018 the hard work and dedication of
our team members helped produce pre-tax profit of 1.9 billion or 2.8
billion excluding net special charges.1 Looking ahead we will continue
to focus on our bedrock principle that when we take care of our team
members they will take the best possible care of our customers which in
turn takes care of our great company.
We are guided by our three long-term strategic objectives:
• Make Culture a Competitive Advantage: Our team members are
our most important asset. We’ve added more than 15000 people
to our team since the merger and we’re focused on supporting
their professional growth by building a culture of learning and
development. In 2018 we partnered with Harvard Business
School Publishing to launch Harvard ManageMentor which
offers on-demand online courses with skill-building exercises and
business development guidance for more than 40 topics.
Our company’s focus on inclusion and diversity has never been
more deliberate. In 2018 we responded to feedback in this area
by engaging an industry expert to look more closely at inclusion
and diversity at American to highlight where we can better meet
the needs of our team members customers and the communities
we serve. Some 75000 team members completed computerbased implicit bias training in 2018 and all 130000 will complete
the training in 2019. We will roll out in-person implicit bias
training for all team members beginning this year as well.
• Create a World-Class Customer Experience: Since the merger
creating a consistent and exceptional experience for customers
across our network has been a top priority. We have invested
billions in new products and services and have more than
500 customer-facing projects underway with most of them
taking place at our airports.
We’ve also added more than 200 new routes and 41 new stations
to our network over the past five years and combined more than
650 systems to help our team members serve customers better.
On board our aircraft customers now enjoy greater connectivity
to high-speed Wi-Fi and enhanced entertainment while visitors
to our lounges in many airports are enjoying recent upgrades. All
of this adds up to a more modern comfortable and connected
experience for our customers.
• Build American Airlines to Thrive Forever: With the merger
of American and US Airways we created the largest airline in
the world and we’re committed to ensuring that our airline
will continue to thrive now and into the future. Achieving our
financial objectives and investing heavily in airport infrastructure
— such as our 1.6 billion project at Los Angeles International
Airport (LAX) — will help us better serve our customers and team
members while positioning our company for success for many
more years to come.
Thriving in the future also means being mindful of our
environmental impacts as an airline and doing our part toward
responsible energy use and fuel conservation. Currently 100
percent of electricity purchased at our Dallas-Fort Worth-area
facilities is from renewable sources. We’ve taken delivery of more
than 500 aircraft since the merger giving American the youngest
fleet of any U.S. network carrier. And we continue to introduce
new more fuel-efficient aircraft into our fleet while retiring the
same number of older planes.
Together these three strategic objectives represent the important
responsibility we have to protect the pride each of us has in American
and to ensure that it lives on for those who will take care of this great
airline long after we are gone.
With that in mind we have organized our 2018 Corporate Responsibility
Report around these themes to highlight our achievements and to
acknowledge the work that remains. We’ve made tremendous progress
to date and we look forward to continuing the journey with you as we
reach many more exciting milestones in the years ahead.

groundbreaking merger with Northwest Airlines which
created the foundation for the transformation of our company.
Every year since the merger we have built on the success of
the previous year learning lessons and honing our strategy to
achieve more for our people our customers our communities
and our shareholders.
First and foremost in our mind is running a safe reliable and
customer-focused operation. In 2018 we had 143 cancel-free
days across the entire Delta system including both the
mainline and regional carriers up from 90 days just a year
ago. We accelerated revenue growth to 8% on an
increasingly diverse revenue base and offset over 90% of the
2 billion increase in fuel costs compared to the prior year. In
2018 more than half of our revenue was generated from
premium products our loyalty program aircraft maintenance
and cargo relying substantially less on the Main Cabin
product. Importantly we saw improvement in cost
performance and reduced non-fuel unit cost growth below the
rate of general inflation. We continued to strengthen our
brand achieving a record high domestic net promoter score in
2018 with improvement in all geographic regions. And we
continue to launch partnerships with carriers throughout the
world — we started a joint venture with Korean Air signed an
agreement with WestJet in Canada and filed for regulatory
approval to bring together the separate joint ventures with
Virgin Atlantic and Air France-KLM.
We broke records flying more people than ever and widening
the gap with the competition. We unveiled new routes to
destinations across the globe and took delivery of world-class
aircraft including the A220 as we continue to transform our
fleet. We opened a state-of-the-art engine shop and outfitted
60000 people in stylish and functional new uniforms. We
deployed innovative new technology to our pilots flight
attendants and airport agents enhanced our airports and
forged new relationships with other carriers as we accelerate
our global expansion. We made significant progress leveling
the playing field with state-subsidized Gulf region airlines.
Because our people are our foundation for 2018 we paid
industry-leading compensation including more than 1.3 billion
in profit sharing. For our shareholders we produced an after-tax
return well above our cost of capital paid 900 million in
dividends and repurchased 1.6 billion in shares. We continued
to strengthen our balance sheet lowering our cost of borrowing
and improving the funded status of our pension plan.
Throughout it all Delta people worked tirelessly to maintain
our unmatched standard of excellence safety and reliability.
The human touch that Delta people provide is unique and
it’s what continually sets us apart. Our culture — dedicated
to servant leadership a passion for our business supporting
our communities and building a sustainable future — is an
advantage no one can match.
Our powerful consumer brand combined with our unmatched
competitive advantages including the best employees in the
business industry-leading operational reliability a strong
global network growing customer loyalty and an investment
grade balance sheet support continued advancement as we
create long-term value for shareholders. Every day we
become more passionate about running the best airline on the
planet and serving as many customers as possible.

complex transactions with Time Warner
Cable and Bright House Networks putting
three companies together in order to
create a new company with a larger and
more concentrated footprint giving us
the scale to innovate and grow faster.
After two and a half years of integration
Charter is beginning to benefit from those
transactions in all the ways we expected.
When we started the process of pursuing
additional scale in cable in 2013 we
knew that to fully benefit from any
acquisitions we would need to create
a single operating entity with a unified
product marketing technology and
service infrastructure. We have spent
over two years doing that. And while we
still have some work to do virtually all of
the customer-facing initiatives related to
our integration are now behind us.
As of the end of 2018 we had migrated
over 70% of our acquired residential
customers to our Spectrum pricing
and packaging. In 2018 we also
completed our all-digital initiative and
the upgrade to DOCSIS 3.1 allowing us
to offer Gigabit speeds across our entire
footprint. Our service infrastructure is
now national specialized and consistent
and our field operations and customer
operations insourcing are nearly complete.
Finally we launched Spectrum MobileTM
last summer with positive early results.
Despite all of that integration activity
Charter performed well operationally and
financially in 2018. We added 1.3 million
Internet customers in 2018 for growth
of 5.3%. For the full year we grew our
cable revenue2
 by 4.7% to 43.5 billion
and total revenue grew to over 43.6
billion. Our 2018 cable Adjusted EBITDA2
grew by a strong 6.5% to 16.3 billion.
And net income attributable to Charter
shareholders reached over 1.2 billion.
In addition we generated 2.8 billion
of cable free cash flow2
 in 2018 and
repurchased approximately 5.0 billion
of Charter stock and Charter Holding
partnership units despite investing
nearly 500 million through the launch
of Spectrum Mobile. As we look to 2019
in addition to completing the last pieces
of our integration we remain focused
on a number of key strategic priorities
including:
? Driving higher sales volumes: Late in
the third quarter we executed the full
market launch of Spectrum Mobile
with the goal of using that product
to drive faster overall customer
relationship growth. We have
positioned Spectrum Mobile to be
the triple play driver for connectivity

strategy that we pursued with wireline
voice over the last decade. We expect
our effectiveness at selling mobile to
continue to improve especially as we
expand our “bring-your-own-device”
program throughout 2019. Ultimately
we believe that the consumer savings
from our mobile offering will lead to
better retention and drive incremental
cable sales over the longer term.
? Reducing service transactions and
churn: With the vast majority of our
integration behind us we expect to
see a meaningful reduction in network
activity customer equipment swaps
service calls and truck rolls. Service
activity should also decline as our
better products pricing and service
across a larger base of customers
improve and as we begin to benefit
from enhanced online self-service
and greater levels of self-installation.
We anticipate the lower level of
activity in 2019 will raise customer
satisfaction reduce churn and extend
customer lifetimes.
? Reducing capital intensity: Our
goal at the beginning of this process
was to put our combined assets
in a position to operate as a single
entity and to grow faster over the
long term. As a result we needed
to increase our capital spending in
the short term. That higher spending
is now behind us and cable capital
intensity will fall significantly in 2019
as planned but also beyond 2019
as CPE spend per home declines
consumers increasingly install their
own devices the reliability of our
plant improves and our network
becomes increasingly cloud-based
and IP-driven—all on higher
expected revenue.
Ultimately our long-term growth
opportunity comes from our powerful
easy-to-upgrade network that allows us
to offer data-rich wireline and wireless
products that consumers want and
businesses need. We believe our current
customer relationship penetration is
low relative to our potential given the
current and future quality of our wireline
and wireless products. The capability of 
our plant will continue to expand with
advanced DOCSIS products and the
convergence of our wireline and wireless
architectures allowing us to offer highcapacity high-compute low-latency
connectivity products both inside and
out of the home.
We believe we have an excellent runway
for customer growth and significant
opportunities for operational cost
efficiencies from improving products and
service and by reducing transactions.
With our biggest integration initiatives
behind us we are in a position to drive
long-term sustainable customer
relationship growth and Adjusted
EBITDA growth. Additionally our
expected growth combined with our
declining capital intensity balance
sheet strategy and tax assets should
yield industry-leading free cash flow per
share growth in the coming years.
I would like to thank our investors for
their continued support and all of our
employees for their dedication.

74,Best Buy,42879,72,42151,125000,Hubert B. Joly,Chairman &  Chief Executive Officer,Retailing,Specialty Retailers: Other,25,Richfield,MN,44.8832982,-93.2830021,"Dear Fellow Shareholders:
On April 15 we announced an evolution of leadership roles at Best Buy. At our annual
shareholder meeting on June 11 I will transition to the newly created role of executive
chairman of the board and Ms. Corie Barry our current chief financial and strategic
transformation officer will become the fifth CEO in Best Buy’s 53-year history. Also
elevated to a broader role will be Mike Mohan who moves from being our domestic chief
operating officer to the company’s president and chief operating officer.
In this context I want to share with you my pride in what we have accomplished in the
last seven years my confidence in the future and my excitement about my new role as
executive chairman of the board.
Before I do this let me say a few words about the evolution of leadership roles at the
company we recently announced.
First I am very proud of the seamless transition we have decided to implement as it
reflects positively on our momentum as well as our focus on executive development and
succession planning. It is clearly designed to ensure strategic and leadership continuity. I
am grateful to the members of our Board of Directors for their diligence and care in
overseeing this critical process. In many ways I believe their work on this transition was
world class and can stand as a model for effective CEO transitions.
The choice of timing of a CEO transition is probably more of an art than a science. I
personally felt it was the right time for me to trigger this leadership transition for several
reasons.
First I felt we had achieved what I had hoped to accomplish when I joined the company
in 2012. As you will see below I am proud of what we have delivered for our customers
employees vendors shareholders and communities.
Second I felt we had built the depth and breadth of talent necessary to carry Best Buy
into the future. Last September we put in place a new leadership organization by
elevating Corie and Mike to new roles with greater responsibilities. In the time since I
have been impressed by the effectiveness of our team and these leaders.
Third with a clear and exciting purpose to enrich lives through technology we set out
two years ago to implement a strategy focused on addressing key human needs in
entertainment productivity communication food security and health and wellness. I
am pleased to report that we have essentially achieved our fiscal 2021 revenue and non-
GAAP operating income targets two years ahead of plan. While we still have a lot to do
from a transformation standpoint it is clear we are on the right path.
Fourth we have announced plans to host a meeting with the investment community
later this year. I thought it was important that the leaders who stand in front of this
important audience and lay out our road map for the future be the team that is
responsible for carrying that strategy forward.
Proud of our accomplishments
I am extremely proud of what we have achieved collectively since I joined the company
in September 2012 a time when we were facing a range of challenges. We have made
progress on multiple fronts in ways that have positively impacted all of our stakeholders.
We reconnected with our customers in a meaningful way through a set of key decisions
aimed at improving the experience for people no matter how they chose to engage with
Best Buy. We took price off the table with a price-match policy and have made significant
investments in our online and in-store shopping experiences — and our customers have
noticed. In fact our Net Promoter Score has increased more than 1500 basis points
since 2012 and we have more than doubled our U.S. online sales to 6.5 billion and 17%
of revenue.
As a part of our growth strategy we launched our In-Home Advisor program which
provides free in-home technology consultations. During fiscal 2019 we expanded to
more than 500 advisors and they made collectively more than 175000 visits to
customers’ homes where they are able to address customer needs in a more human and
effective fashion unlocking latent incremental demand.
Moving even more boldly into the home last summer we launched our Total Tech
Support program which provides 24/7 support for all of a customer’s technology
regardless of when and where they bought it. At the end of fiscal 2019 we had more
than one million members in this program.
Our work in the health space is another example of our intention to deepen our
relationships with consumers by addressing their key human needs. Late last year we
formed Best Buy Health and acquired GreatCall a leading connected health services
provider for aging consumers in order to accelerate our strategy to help seniors live
longer in their homes with the help of technology. The integration of GreatCall into our
business has met if not exceeded our expectations.
Our success with our customers is driven by the enthusiasm and talent of our
employees. Over the past several years we have invested in our workforce in a number
of ways including by providing enhanced employee training that has won praise and
awards for its quality. In addition we repurposed some of the savings from last year’s 
corporate tax reform to fund one-time bonuses for employees as well as expand
employee benefits to include paid caregiver leave expanded mental health benefits
paid time off for part-time employees and backup childcare.
More broadly we have also worked hard to instill a culture built on purposeful leadership.
Put simply purposeful leadership recognizes that all companies are human organizations
composed of individuals working together for a collective purpose and that “magic”
happens if you can connect what drives individual employees and the purpose of the
company in an authentic fashion.
As a result of these and many other actions our employee engagement scores have
improved and employee turnover rates in our stores are at record lows.
We continue to partner with our vendors (i.e. the world’s foremost technology
companies) to help them commercialize their technology. Over the last seven years our
vendors have invested with us to improve the customer experience through storeswithin-stores and other unique vendor experiences. We ended fiscal 2019 with more
than 5000 of these experiences across our U.S. stores.
We also have created significant shareholder value improved our profitability and
returned capital to shareholders.
We have generated five consecutive years of comparable sales growth and increased
our non-GAAP operating income rate by more than 100 basis points to 4.6%.* Our
commitment to reduce costs and drive efficiencies is a crucial factor in our improved
financials. In fact in the past seven years we have achieved 1.9 billion in cost savings
and efficiencies that have helped us fund investments and offset pressures in the
business.

Our non-GAAP return on invested capital now stands at 25.8% up from 10.5% in fiscal
2013 indicating that our formula of investments in our future revenue growth and cost
takeout is producing attractive returns.*

We have generated substantial free cash flow which has allowed us to continue to
reinvest in our business and return capital to shareholders through dividend payments
and share buybacks.
Our capital allocation strategy is to fund operations and investments in growth including
potential acquisitions and then return excess free cash flow over time to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to target a non-GAAP dividend
payout ratio between 35% and 45%.*
In the past seven years we have returned more than 8 billion to shareholders through a
combination of share repurchases and dividends. Since the end of fiscal 2013 our total
shareholder return is 335% compared to 104% for the S&P 500.
At the core of our turnaround and growth strategy was the decision to operate the
company with the belief that we will do well by doing good. Specifically we seek to be a
responsible corporate citizen in our interactions with all of our stakeholders including
our customers employees vendors shareholders communities and the environment. 
As it relates to our impact on the communities in which we work and live and the planet
more broadly we have focused on three initiatives.
• Teen Tech Centers expansion: I am proud to say that in cooperation with our
partners we are well on our way toward creating a national network of 60 Best
Buy Teen Tech Centers as part of our broader effort to train hundreds of
thousands of underserved teens each year for the tech-related jobs of our modern
economy.
• Carbon footprint reduction: We are determined to do our part in addressing global
climate change and have pledged to reduce our carbon footprint by 60% (over a
2009 baseline) by 2020. We are currently at 51% and expect to meet our pledge.
• Recycling: We operate the largest consumer electronics recycling program in the
country and are well on our way toward meeting our goal of recycling two billion
pounds of electronics by 2020.
All of this work has been recognized through a number of awards this year. The most
notable was being named No. 1 on Barron’s annual 100 Most Sustainable Companies list
which is based on 200 data points including community engagement human rights carbon
emissions business ethics and more.
Confident in our future
As we look ahead there are several reasons why we are excited about the future of Best
Buy.
We are excited by the opportunities related to technology innovation that have the
potential to drive customer demand over the next several years. These come in three
shapes: expanded penetration of existing technology introduction of new technology in
existing categories and expansion of consumer technologies in new areas.
Notably we see opportunities in existing categories like home theater related to the
increasing penetration of large screen sizes 4K and OLED and the introduction of new
technologies such as 8K. In mobile we will be actively participating in the rise of 5G
which has the potential to unlock very interesting use cases over the next several years.
In computing the interest in gaming continues to accelerate and the performance
necessary for this is driving innovation across both hardware and accessories. We see
significant opportunities in smart home technology. Notably the U.S. retail market size of
“internet of things” connected hardware is forecasted to triple by 2025. This growth is
buoyed by products like connected cameras which are expected to grow from 18%
penetration of U.S. homes in 2018 to more than 50% by 2022 according to a recent
report from Activate. We also believe that digital health is an exciting area with enormous
opportunity from the use of technology to help customers with their health fitness and 
sleep among others things across multiple age groups from babies to seniors. As an
illustration of the opportunity the number of digital health exhibitors at the Consumer
Electronics Show in January was up almost 25% versus last year.
The next reason we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us is that we believe
that the purpose driving our strategy is extremely relevant. Our purpose is to enrich lives
through technology by addressing key customer needs in areas such as entertainment
productivity communication food security and health and wellness. We are
encouraged by the steps we have taken in this direction and see the potential from
expanding this focus to build deeper lasting customer relationships.
In parallel to this we continue to be excited by the potential for further cost-reduction
opportunities that can help us fund the investments in our strategy and offset pressures
in the business. During fiscal 2019 we achieved 265 million in annualized cost
reductions and efficiencies bringing the cumulative total to 500 million since the
second quarter of fiscal 2018. This is towards our fiscal 2021 goal of 600 million. Since
the launch of Renew Blue in 2012 we have taken out 1.9 billion of costs.
Finally we continue to be excited by the power of our incredibly talented people who
are engaged customer-oriented and aligned with our purpose and strategy. Not only
have we built a broad and deep talent pool but we have also built a strong culture which
is based on a handful of powerful beliefs. We believe that:
1. Work can be an instrument for doing good things in the world.
2. A company is a human organization - a group of individuals working together in
pursuit of a goal not a soul-less body.
3. The purpose of a corporation is to contribute to the common good by having a
positive impact on its customers employees vendors shareholders and the
communities in which it operates. A business is more than for profit. It is about
doing well by doing good.
4. “Magic” happens if you can connect what drives the individuals working at the
company to the purpose of the company. More broadly we believe that great
things happen at companies where the individuals who work there can feel a
sense of purpose develop personal connections have autonomy develop a
certain mastery and feel they are in a growth environment.
5. Work is not about attempting to achieve perfection but about human
connections. We believe performance and growth come from accepting and
embracing our imperfections and vulnerabilities.
6. Leadership is not about power fame glory or money. Leadership is about
purposeful authentic human service.
***
Altogether this gives us the sense that now is the time to play offense — to play to win —
and accelerate our transformation both from a customer and revenue standpoint and
from an efficiency standpoint.
Looking forward to my new role
As the executive chairman I will focus on a couple of areas with the overriding goal to
continue to ensure the success of the company.
First I will continue to chair our board. Our board is a fantastic resource for our
leadership team and it plays a critical role in shaping and supporting our strategy and
more broadly the future of Best Buy. Our board has evolved over the last seven years
with approximately 85% of directors new since 2012. As a company we believe that
diversity is crucial to our business our employees our customers and our shareholders.
In support of this belief the board has sought director candidates who not only had the
skill sets to support our current and future strategies such as health technology but
were also diverse. As a result our current board is comprised of six women and six men
with a diverse mix of skill sets and ethnicities. Notably when our new CEO joins the
board in June it will become majority female!
Second I will do whatever I can to support Corie and the management team in the
context of the CEO transition. To that end I will provide advice and support on topics
ranging from strategy and M&A to capability building and leadership development. In
addition and at the direction of the new CEO I will continue to be focused on helping
the company in the areas of government relations and public affairs.
***
In conclusion we are energized by our results our momentum and our opportunities. It
is an exciting and momentous time for our company.
On a personal level I want to thank you our shareholders for your support over the past
seven years. Likewise I want to thank my colleagues for our collaboration and their
friendship. Working together we turned around and then grew this wonderful company
and it has been the honor of my professional lifetime to work with all of you. The 
company is in good hands with our new leadership and I am confident that the journey
we began in 2012 will continue well into the years ahead.

Invesco V.I. American Franchise Fund
Market conditions and your Fund
Calendar year 2018 proved to be an increasingly volatile time for US equities. In
January 2018 US equity markets steadily moved higher as investors remained
enthused about the passage of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in late
December 2017. However in February
2018 volatility returned to the US stock
and bond markets. Worries about how
rising interest rates might affect economic growth concerns about a potential
trade war and heightened geopolitical
tensions caused the US stock markets to
pull back and volatility to increase.
US equity markets generally recovered
in the second quarter of 2018 as strong
US retail sales and low unemployment
buoyed markets. Throughout the summer US equities moved higher as corporate profits surged. Several US equity indexes reached new highs despite
potential headwinds including trade tensions tariff announcements and contagion concerns over a Turkish currency
crisis. After a relatively quiet summer
market volatility noticeably rose in October as US equity markets suffered a
sharp sell-off through year-end amid rising interest rates and concerns that higher inflation could mean a more restrictive
monetary policy. In this environment
there was a flight to safety as investors
fled to defensive areas of the equities
markets like health care and utilities and
US Treasuries.
Given signs of a strong economy the
US Federal Reserve raised interest rates
four times during the year: in March
June September and December 2018.
Following December’s Federal Reserve
meeting Chairman Jerome Powell raised
interest rates for the fourth time in 2018
by 25 basis points to a targeted range of
2.25% to 2.50% and lowered guidance
from three to two rate hikes in 2019 signaling a slightly more dovish stance than
expected.1 In contrast the European Central Bank and central banks in several other countries maintained extraordinarily
accommodative monetary policies.
During the year the Fund produced a
loss and underperformed the style-specific benchmark. Stock selection in the communication services and consumer staples sectors as well as overweight exposures in the communication services and
energy sectors were key detractors from
relative performance. Key contributors to
relative performance included stock selection and underweight exposures in the
industrials and materials sectors as well
as stock selection in the information technology (IT) sector. Ancillary cash was
also beneficial to relative returns given
stock market volatility during the year.
Within communication services entertainment industry holdings Nintendo and
Activision Blizzard were key individual
detractors from both absolute and relative returns for the year. Nintendo’s stock
fell in the second quarter following a decline in its Switch console sales that resulted from a lack of momentum in Nintendo Labo a series of do-it-yourself kits
that work with the Switch console. Nintendo also saw a lack of Switch support
for popular third-party titles such as
“Fortnite.” Activision Blizzard experienced weak third-quarter results and reduced its outlook after experiencing a
lower-than-expected performance of the
expansion pack for its key “Destiny” title
and a lack of a major game release for
2019. In general global video game
stocks saw weakness in the fourth quarter as a result of China’s regulatory headwinds combined with a market rotation
out of growth and toward defensive
areas.
During the year an overweight allocation in Facebook detracted from the
Fund’s performance relative to the stylespecific benchmark. The social media
company faced a few tough periods in
2018 with the first being a major sell-off
in March following the announcement
that Cambridge Analytica (not a Fund
holding) had harvested personal data
from profiles to use for targeted political
ads. In July Facebook’s management released guidance indicating slower-thanexpected revenue growth in the second
half of 2018 driven by the migration of

users from the application’s News Feed to
its Stories section along with higherthan-expected expense growth related to
safety security and privacy controls. We
continued to hold the stock but decreased exposure throughout the year.
Within the energy sector Noble Energy Marathon Oil and Occidental Petroleum were among detractors from the
Fund’s performance versus the style-specific benchmark for the year. In general
the energy sector was among the worstperforming sectors this year given volatility in oil prices. We used weakness in energy stocks to reallocate into companies
with higher conviction that we believed
were higher quality such as Noble Energy. Shares of Noble Energy have
underperformed other large exploration
and production companies for the last
several years given its exposure to Mediterranean gas markets which are still
ramping up and less understood by investors. We received shares of Marathon Oil
following its takeover of Andeavor (not a
Fund holding) and have maintained the
shares. Occidental Petroleum was sold
during the year as part of our original
reason for owning the stock had deteriorated. Gaps between crude oil prices in
the Permian Basin versus Brent Oil had
been wide earlier in the year due to energy infrastructure constraints. The gap
narrowed.
Within the consumer discretionary sector retail and e-commerce giant Amazon.com was a key contributor to both
absolute and relative returns for the year.
Amazon reported strong revenue growth
across all segments and strong profit
margins in its retail and Amazon Web Services (AWS) segments. AWS provides ondemand cloud computing services enabling retailers to increase operational
efficiency in order to have a global reach
and gain scale quickly.
Within the IT sector salesforce.com
Mastercard and Palo Alto Networks
contributed to both absolute and relative
returns. salesforce.com provides customer relationship management (CRM) software that is delivered via internet browsers and on mobile devices to help
companies increase sales and promote
customer satisfaction. Quarterly revenue
results were strong during 2018 with
double-digit growth over the previous
year. Further the company continued to
increase future guidance on these strong
results. Mastercard experienced strong
results for much of the year given payment volume growth due to its thoughtful
approach toward investments within the
business-to-business payments arena
blockchain technology and fast ACH processing. Palo Alto Networks is a cybersecurity company that provides advanced
firewall protection and helps businesses
protect against cyber-attacks. Unlike its
competitors Palo Alto Network’s services
run on the same hardware and threats
are evaluated with its unique “single
pass” technology. We believed this would
help Palo Alto Networks continue to gain
market share as security breaches increase worldwide.
At the end of the year the Fund’s largest overweight positions relative to the
Russell 1000 Growth Index were in the
communication services consumer discretionary health care and energy sectors. The largest underweight exposures
were in the IT industrials consumer staples financials and real estate sectors.
Our overweight exposures are primarily
focused on companies that we believe will
benefit from technology-driven market
share shifts demographics and changing
consumer behaviors. While our underweight exposures are primarily driven by
late economic cycle dynamics such as
excess inventory and slowing growth
rates in combination with reduced and in
some cases reversed fiscal stimulus or
high geopolitical uncertainty.
Our view is that we are in a slowing but
not declining growth environment as the
benefits of US tax stimulus and deregulation are offset by higher interest rates
rising labor costs and trade pressures. In
such an environment true growth will
likely remain scarce and we believe the
market will favor companies that can produce growth and compound earnings in
spite of the economic cycle. We believe
that change is the fuel for growth thus
we are seeking to identify “share-takers”
companies that can gain market share
from technology-enabled advantages in
their business models and from disruptive shifts in consumer behavior. Though
we anticipate a possible economic slowing we continue to prudently balance the
Fund’s portfolio between dynamic growth
opportunities and more durable growth
opportunities.

We were able to look back on a long history of contributing to the progress of science again and again. Above all however we have been directing our focus on what lies ahead. After all the most important history remains the one we are writing today.

In business terms 2018 proved challenging but we held up well over the year. We also made decisions that will guide our future path and allow us to generate profitable growth again in 2019.

In our Healthcare business sector we presented a number of results from clinical studies involving our drug candidates. Not all of the studies achieved the results we had hoped for; this is normal when developing innovative medicines. We gained any important insights that will help us streamline the development of our Biopharma pipeline. One further key milestone was the FDA’s acceptance of our application for market approval of cladribine tablets as a potential treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Finally we also further refined our focus on innovation-driven businesses through the sale of the over-the-counter products business (Consumer Health).
Growth in our Life Science business sector grow faster than the market. We have further expanded our position as the most profitable technology and solutions supplier in the life science industry. We recorded particularly strong sales growth in our Process Solutions area where we offer leading-edge processing technologies for biotech and pharmaceutical companies as well as products critical to the advancement of cell and gene therapy. Moreover our e-commerce platform made a significant contribution to business growth.
In the Performance Materials business sector we have developed a new strategy and restructured our organization. With the help of our multi-year ?Bright Future” transformation program we will implement our new strategy and create the basis for future profitable growth beyond 2019. Our goals in taking this step are to sharpen our focus on our customers’ needs as well as to centrally decide on the assessment of projects and the related use of resources as part of an integrated approach to research and development.

Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO


Our Group sales in 2018 showed a slight increase of 2.2% to € 14.8 billion1 supported primarily by the Life Science and Healthcare business sectors. EBITDA pre the key performance indicator to measure our operations dropped by – 10.5% to € 3.8 billion1. There are several reasons for this decline: Last year we invested in research and development as well as the market launches of the new products in our pharmaceutical business. Our Liquid Crystals business recorded further price declines. For the most part however the decline in earnings was due to negative foreign exchange effects that are primarily attributable to the development of the currencies of various growth markets. Over the past year we reduced our debt load by € 3.4 billion and thus reached our target for 2018 which was to achieve a net financial debt to EBITDA pre ratio of less than two.

Our shares essentially closed out the year 2018 at the level they recorded at the start of the year. The shares performed well when compared with the sector particularly in the fourth quarter and closed out the year above the relevant benchmark index for the pharmaceutical industry2 and well above the relevant chemical industry index3 and the German benchmark DAX index. For 2018 we will propose to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of € 1.25 per share.

As you can see we reached a solid result in 2018. This result is largely thanks to our employees. Numbering some 52000 worldwide they worked hard and achieved much in 2018. On behalf of the entire Executive Board I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for their extraordinary dedication.

Once again there is much to do for us this year. The markets and industries in which we operate continue to develop at a rapid pace.

Precision medicine will profoundly change the entire healthcare sector. New technologies and high-performance data analyses will enable us to gain an ever greater understanding of serious and complex diseases. Looking ahead we will be able to tailor medicines even more exactly to the needs of each patient.
Falling equipment costs improved access to knowledge and new financing options will raise scientific research and development to a completely new level. It will for example become easier for smaller biotech companies to bring new technologies and therapies to market maturity with greater speed.
At the same time more and more items in our everyday lives will be interconnected. The Internet of Things is becoming a reality and unimagined possibilities are emerging in almost all areas of our lives.
1Excluding the Consumer Health business divested in 2018.
2MSCI European Pharma Index.
3Dow Jones European Chemical Index.
This is good news for us because we are helping to shape all these developments. Science is at the heart of everything we do. It forms the basis for the technologies we get off the ground. Every day our more than 7000 researchers work to push the boundaries of the possible.

In Healthcare we continue to pursue our long-term goal of becoming a global specialty innovator. To this end we focus on oncology immuno-oncology and immunology. Our pharma pipeline harbors great potential which we want to harness further in 2019 and beyond also in collaboration with strong partners.

Life Science plays a leading role in attractive markets and we want it to stay that way. This is the reason we are strengthening fast-growing business areas such as bioprocessing technology for the manufacturing of medicines. It is also the reason we are pushing promising new technologies such as our BioContinuum Platform. It will help us to significantly simplify the complex process of producing biological medicines over the coming years as well as accelerate it.

In Performance Materials we aim to expand our position as a leading solutions supplier for the electronics industry. The electronics sector is considerably benefiting from the megatrends of digitalization mobility and urbanization. It services a broad range of different customers making it less susceptible to the ups and downs of individual markets. In particular our business with semiconductor materials will continue to advance Performance Materials over the long term.

At our company we are also working on technologies of the future beyond our three business sectors.

The announced Syntropy joint venture we plan to create with Palantir Technologies represents a particularly exciting project. Syntropy aims to markedly accelerate cancer research. To achieve this the large volume of biomedical data being collected by scientists and physicians worldwide every day plays a key role. This data may prove very valuable to science. Far too often however it’s not accessible to the scientists who need it. We aim to change this through Syntropy. We want to enable researchers to structure and analyze data from various sources through the use of pattern recognition. In addition it is planned that scientists can securely exchange data in a traceable manner while retaining control of their own data at all times.

Syntropy is a project with considerable potential an attribute it shares with other issues of the future – for example new interfaces between the human body and the digital world and new technological approaches for liquid biopsy or for the biotechnological production of meat. Please see the magazine section of this Annual Report for more information on these issues.

To advance our research we are present in all of the world’s technology regions which of course today also means China. Alongside Germany the United States and Israel China has become a top location for science and technology and we are investing heavily in the country. Last November we announced the establishment of our new Innovation Hub in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou one of the country’s major technology hubs. We are also stepping up our production in China: we operate one of our biggest pharmaceutical production plants in the eastern Chinese city of Nantong.

Contributing to advancements in science and technology is a great opportunity - but it also comes with considerable responsibility. We strongly believe what matters is not just what a company does but also how it achieves its goals. Our long history has taught us that sustainable business success always derives from responsible conduct. I am very pleased we achieved a very good fourth place in the 2018 ?Access to Medicine” index for the second time in a row. Every two years experts from the Access to Medicine Foundation compare the activities of the 20 leading pharmaceutical companies in this area. Our fourth-place ranking is a gratifying recognition of our commitment to improving access to healthcare for people in developing countries and it is a strong incentive for us to continue our efforts.

For us scientific research and responsible entrepreneurship go hand in hand. Only when combined do they enable technological advancement that benefits all of us – our customers our employees society and of course you our shareholders.

Over the coming years we at Merck KGaA Darmstadt Germany want to develop breakthrough technologies that will make a substantial difference in the lives of millions of people. This is what drives us now and in the future.

77,Honeywell International,41802,77,40534,131000,Darius Adamczyk,President Chief Executive Officer &  Director,Industrials,Electronics Electrical Equip.,25,Morris Plains,NJ,40.8395922,-74.4818698,"This is my 16th and final letter to the shareowners of Honeywell. When I compare where we are
today with the bleak early days of my first letter—which appeared in Honeywell’s 2002 Annual Report—
I am reminded of what a tremendously fulfilling experience it has been to lead this great company.
Those early days are fun to think about but they sure were unpleasant at the time. Back then we
were an underperforming problem-filled company with numerous legacy issues. Now we are a
company that routinely receives awards for financial environmental and community performance. I am
proud to have played a role in bringing about all of these positive changes and building the foundation
for the company we are today.
When I first came to Honeywell an analyst asked what I wanted my legacy to be. I said there were
three things I wanted to accomplish. First I wanted anyone associated with me during my time at
Honeywell to be able to say they had done well. Clearly this has been important to our investors and
the vast majority are pleased with our performance over time. But employees are investors too. In a
recent analysis we found that about 2500 employees and former employees had become 401(k)
millionaires. These were by no means only executives—in fact 94% of them are below the executive
band level and some have salaries in the low 40s. To be able to create this level of wealth for
employees feels really good.
Second I wanted Honeywell to be a place targeted by recruiters for leaders of all kinds. Of course
I also wanted Honeywell to be a place where leaders tended to stay because they did well and the work
was fulfilling. I believe we have done very well in developing and retaining leaders as well as many
other talented employees in all disciplines around the world.
Third I wanted to be able to own my shares ten years after I left the company—or to say it another
way I wanted the people processes and portfolio we put in place to sustain Honeywell’s performance
well beyond the time of my retirement. This is how institutions are created–not by one leader
performing well but by the next leader sustaining and building on that performance. Nearly one year
past the time when Darius became CEO things are looking good for me and other long-term
shareowners. While Honeywell’s processes are much more efficient and effective than they were
16 years ago there is still plenty of upside to be gained through further improvements. Our portfolio
continues to get better as we improve our growth profile with acquisitions and exits. We have terrific
leaders in place and that is particularly true of our CEO Darius Adamczyk.
The CEO makes a huge difference in the performance of a company. Leadership matters and
Darius is a tremendous leader. He has an intense desire to win; he is smart analytical and thinks
independently; he has the courage of his convictions; and he isn’t afraid to make difficult decisions that
make the Company better. He is intensely curious and approaches every aspect of the job with passion
and enthusiasm. He focuses on having the right people organized correctly and aligned around
superior business strategies.
Darius will be the first to tell you a terrific first year is great but he will judge himself on how he
outperforms during his full tenure. Having watched Darius over a number of years and having worked
with him closely over the last two years during our transition I am extremely confident we chose the
right leader for Honeywell. Darius is building on what I did to create a company that generates
tremendous value and he will take Honeywell to the next level. You will be impressed. All I ask is that
you remember I was instrumental in picking him!
It has really been an honor for me to lead Honeywell. Our people have been terrific and we far
exceeded what anyone ever expected of us. It was incredibly fun to build a company. It is even more
rewarding to see it built even further. For Honeywell the best is yet to come.

Dear Fellow Stockholders
Several years ago United Airlines embarked on a journey to realize the great promise of our airline
and to make United the airline that customers choose to fly. On this journey we are focused on elevating
our customer service to new heights delivering value to our stockholders and continuing to achieve excellent
operational reliability.
In 2017 United led the industry with the best on-time departure performance of our largest
competitors. In 2018 United built on that success delivering our second-best on-time departure
performance in our company’s history—all while flying the most passengers ever in a single year.
On the financial front in 2018 our team captured the attention of the industry by successfully
controlling operating costs while simultaneously delivering on our multi-year growth strategy. We embarked
on that strategy by strengthening our global network which already towered above the industry as the best
of any airline and introduced 93 new routes with even more planned for 2019.
In 2018 we introduced our core4 service decision framework. Our core4 principles of safe caring
dependable and efficient align our team members to a broad spirit of service which we believe ensures a
consistency of quality while also allowing each individual employee to use her or his best judgment in serving
our customers in the moment.
Even as United has achieved financial success thanks to our growth plan we have also elevated our
mission to be a good corporate citizen striving not only to improve our service but also to be of service to
people and communities everywhere we operate.
From helping with natural disaster response efforts to taking an active role to help solve difficult
social questions to making an industry-leading commitment to reduce our carbon footprint—we want United
to model good corporate citizenship everywhere we operate.
Across our hub cities United has committed millions of dollars to wonderful community
organizations that are expanding healthy food options for struggling families increasing educational
opportunities for underserved students providing skills and vocational development for individuals in
low-income neighborhoods and much more.
We believe in a United that is both profitable and principled because after all our core shared
purpose as a company is ‘‘Connecting People. Uniting the World.’’
As we look ahead to the rest of 2019 and beyond we are capitalizing on the foundation we’ve built
by focusing our efforts on delivering a level of caring that transcends industry expectations and on keeping
our customers at the center of everything we do. We believe what matters is proof not promise and with
every flight we operate as well as each innovation and improvement we introduce we believe that we are
changing the way people think and feel about United Airlines.
28APR201620292684
These are a few of the many exciting initiatives that we are working on to elevate customer service
at United:
• In January 2019 we announced free DIRECTV service in more than 30000 seats equipped with
satellite streaming entertainment service offering a spectrum of channels.
• Over the course of this year all 26000 of our flight attendants will travel to Chicago to
participate in a series of hands-on interactive sessions and workshops focused on our central
ethos of customer service.
• We are adding more than 1600 United Polaris business class and United First seats to nearly
250 international and domestic aircraft.
• We are introducing the two-cabin 50 seat Bombardier CRJ-550 aircraft and revolutionizing
regional flying by offering more legroom storage and amenities than any other 50-seat regional
aircraft operating today.
• We are introducing a fleet of reconfigured Boeing 767-300ER aircraft which will feature the
highest proportion of premium seats on a widebody aircraft operated by any U.S. carrier
making United the airline of choice for customers traveling the most premier routes in the
world.
• New innovations and refinements to the United App continue as we leverage our digital
advantage and seek to further personalize our customers’ United experience.
• During 2018 we completed several key customer-facing projects that are transforming the
customer experience with the opening of new Polaris lounges in Houston Newark and San
Francisco—complementing our existing Polaris lounge in Chicago. Our fifth Polaris lounge in Los
Angeles opened shortly after the new year adding to the overall redevelopments of Terminals 7
and 8 at Los Angeles International Airport.
• We also completed infrastructure investments in 2018 that will further promote our operational
reliability—including expanding our Denver flight training center and opening a new ground
equipment maintenance facility in Chicago. Additionally we started construction on a new
baggage handling system in Denver and a hangar expansion in Chicago.
In sum the progress we’ve made is thanks to the efforts of United’s more than 90000 team
members working around the world and around the clock.
I could not be more excited about the future of United Airlines. On behalf of our leadership team I
want to express our appreciation to United’s customers employees and stockholders for choosing to join us
on this journey of transformation for United.

making a profit creating jobs and improving communities. This
Prosperity Report demonstrates how Allstate measures up to this
role. It begins with Our Shared Purpose on the opposite page which
articulates our strategic vision values principles and priorities.
Allstate’s business strategy is to increase market share in our traditional auto home and life
insurance products and newer offerings such as electronic device and identity protection. Translating
this strategy into daily activity requires a system of “strategic middleware” including customer value
propositions competitively differentiated business models and annual operating priorities. We are
the only company to offer four distinct customer value propositions for property-liability insurance.
Acquiring SquareTrade and InfoArmor positions us in high growth protection categories with superior
business models. A longer-term aspiration to reduce personal transportation costs for consumers
includes working with ride sharing companies and creating new businesses.
In 2018 Allstate made excellent progress in executing this strategy while delivering on annual
operating priorities. Revenues reached almost 40 billion with premiums increasing 6.9% from the
prior year. Policies in force grew by 36% to over 113 million reflecting outstanding organic growth
from SquareTrade and a 2.9% increase in property-liability policies. Profitability was strong with
adjusted net income* of 2.85 billion and return on equity* of 14.8%.
Reinventing protection requires us to innovate take risks and create change not just react to trends.
Technology investments ensure customers get good value for their hard earned money. For example
auto insurance claims are now settled in hours instead of days by using digital images which requires
fewer employees and lowers costs. At the same time new jobs were created by investing in telematics
for auto insurance and expanding product offerings and distribution. The Allstate family has grown to
88000 members over the past five years an increase of 14400.
Allstate’s culture is based on integrity inclusive diversity and empowering people. We were once again
named among the World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Employee engagement is high
because helping customers navigate unexpected and unwanted events is rewarding. In addition over
32000 Allstaters have clarified their personal purpose through Energy for Life which links their
objectives to Allstate’s.
Empowering others helps fulfill our responsibility to build stronger communities. Allstate’s philanthropy
has enabled over six million youth to volunteer in their communities and helped victims of domestic
violence free themselves from abuse.
All of us at Allstate are thankful for the opportunity to make a difference in society!

2018 can be summed up by two primary drivers: a sharpened focus on core sustainable organic growth and driving a
continuous cost management culture. Over the years we have been a highly entrepreneurial and innovative company
which benefited from asymmetries in global energy markets. Today as a result of evolving market dynamics in energy
information and global trade success requires greater operational excellence with the imperative to efficiently scale
organically. Our team has been laser focused on shifting more of our capital and talent towards businesses that produce
more predictable and sustainable revenue streams. We executed well on this as we hit a few record highs this year most
notably delivering more than 1 billion of gross profit for the first time and improving our operating expense ratio. We
remain committed to these areas of focus and to driving further gains in 2019.
People are at the core of everything we do and our leadership and management have never been stronger. The adage of
people process and technology still stands and in that order; however technology and process are not just an
afterthought. They are embedded infused and deeply entrenched in everything we do for our own operations as well as
those of the customers we serve. In 2018 we further expanded our software digital and service offering across many
areas of the business. And as we sharpen our focus and fortify our base to amplify growth we will selectively pursue
additions to the core while leveraging technology and automation to facilitate integration and drive further organic growth.
Today we are grounded on a solid foundation to generate strong financial results while providing the best solutions for
our clients. We are proud to be a trusted global energy and logistics network enabling global commerce.
Our aviation segment is the best example of our ability to accelerate aggressive organic growth by positioning ourselves
with a comprehensive and durable value proposition. Leveraging our investment in international distribution assets we
continue to expand our global network to provide customers with the most cost-effective and reliable supply solutions as
well as complementary service offerings beyond fuel. Our marine segment is unrivaled in its ability to assist customers in
managing the supply challenges of fuel availability quality and compatibility; which are expected to increase as we
approach the implementation of the new IMO low sulfur regulations that will go into effect on January 1 2020. We have
been actively working with our customers on preparing their bunkering programs with an appropriate risk management
strategy and making provisions within our global network to ensure reliability of quality supply.
On a smaller scale presently is our land segment which has the potential to generate sizable revenue streams in the
future. Our focus on commercial and industrial users of energy in this space captures the essence of World Fuel. It
enables a comprehensive solution for our customers who increasingly want a single source provider for all their energy
needs from liquid fuels renewables gas and power to expertise on how to optimize their own operations and sustainability objectives.
We believe we have a compelling vision and a passionate organization with a burning desire to succeed in building an
enterprise shaped by a sustainable model that earns value share.
I am continually amazed and grateful for the people I call my colleagues and teammates. We embrace our entrepreneurial
heritage and I realized this year it was time to dissolve our 553-word dress code policy to 2-words: Dress appropriately. I
could think of no better way to honor all the generations and nationalities and roles that represent the commercial agility
ingenuity and deep market knowledge that our customers have come to rely on and for what World Fuel Services is
known. At the core of our creativity and innovation is having fun and celebrating the key role we play in connecting and
facilitating global commerce. We are thankful for this exciting and important role.

I continue to be enthusiastic about our business and deeply believe in our future.I’m excited to come to work each day
and I want to thank our shareholders who understand and support our mission. We aim to make your journey with us
steady and prosperous.

nearly 168 years it’s change – embracing it
adapting to it and helping our policyowners
and customers succeed throughout it.
In our company’s early years groundbreaking
innovation meant installing phones and buying
typewriters. Growing our customer base meant
serving New England farmers steamship workers
and Gold Rush pioneers headed west. Today
adapting to change means investing in data
analytics tapping into global markets and more.
Yet while the world continues to shift
dramatically our pledge to our customers has
stayed the same: to provide stability and security
in a world of change and uncertainty. That
mission is at the heart of what we call Live Mutual:
a vision of a world where stronger ties between
people –from friends and family to coworkers
and even strangers – help us navigate life’s most
difficult moments. In 2018 we were proud to
advance that commitment – and put ourselves in
a stronger position to have a lasting impact on
the lives of the people we serve.
Strong demand for our holistic financial
solutions for both individuals and
institutions drove revenue to a record
32 billion last year.
A Strong Foundation for the Future
As a mutual company we measure our progress
not on where our share price ended up for the
year or whether we beat analysts’ estimates.
We measure it on how much closer we are to
helping people build a more confident future.
We did that in 2018 in an environment that was
more volatile than we have seen in some time.
While we continued to benefit from historically
low unemployment solid wage growth and
modest inflation pressure trade wars increased
uncertainty and slowly rising interest rates helped
roil the markets. Geopolitical developments like
Brexit shifting diplomacy with North Korea and
growing populist movements all exacerbated
the uncertainty.
In this increasingly unsettled environment we
once again provided a measure of certainty and
stability. Strong demand for our holistic financial
solutions for both individuals and institutions drove
revenue to a record 32 billion last year while
helping to increase the insurance protection we
provide to more than 700 billion giving people the
security and peace of mind to face life’s
uncertainties. Along the way we also helped
more than half a million new people on their path
to a more secure financial future whether it was as
a breadwinner protecting his or her family a worker
looking to save a few extra dollars for retirement or
a retiree receiving a pension payment.
Dear Fellow Policyowners and Customers
These commitments were supported by a
company as financially strong as ever as we
increased our total adjusted capital to nearly
20 billion and maintained among the highest
ratings of any company in any industry.1 This
same stability enabled us to approve an estimated
1.72 billion dividend payout in 2019 to our eligible
participating policyowners – our highest payout
ever and the 151st consecutive year we have
paid a dividend.2
Most importantly we continued to fulfill our
commitments to you delivering more than
5.3 billion in benefits – with real dollars going to
real people. Young adults. Families. Business owners.
Retirees. Nothing makes me prouder than the fact
that we helped so many in 2018 – and laid a strong
foundation to help even more in the years ahead.
Adapting to a Rapidly Changing World
As we operate from this position of strength we
are constantly assessing what we must do to build
on our success and stay competitive in a rapidly
changing world. In 2018 we continued on our path
to stay nimble while seizing opportunities to
position us strongly for the long term.
One of our biggest priorities continues to be
responding to the biggest trend reshaping
our world: digital transformation. We are seizing
the opportunities that technology has brought
to make our solutions more affordable and
accessible to more people.

analytics to provide protection in a fraction of
the time identify better ways to keep
your assets safe and help you
make the best real-time decisions
about your finances. It’s also why
we are providing our dedicated
network of advisors with digital
capabilities to serve you better
and are creating a seamless
digital experience for purchasing
insurance – from the time you first
apply to when we deliver a claim.
Yet as we adapt to immediate trends we
have also taken steps to maintain our long-term
performance so we can continue investing in our
business and honor our commitments decades
from now. As such we have begun to evolve our
approach to what have long been our key strategic
differentiators – our international insurance and
asset management businesses – by finding
successful and innovative partners to help
maximize their value.
The 2018 sale of our majority interest in MassMutual
Japan to Nippon Life and sale of MassMutual Asia to
Yunfeng Financial Group and several
Asia-based investors are primary
examples. Both transactions
enable us to benefit from
maintaining an ongoing
interest in strongly positioned
entities as well as through
potential strategic partnerships
that will yield additional
opportunities over time. We
expect to reap similar advantages
with our transaction announced last
October in which OppenheimerFunds
Inc. our retail asset management affiliate will
combine with Invesco Ltd. to form one of the largest
asset management firms in the world. Expected to
close in 2019 the transaction will give us the
largest ownership stake in the combined firm
 with expanded global scale greater diversity
of offerings and additional capital that will
 increase our financial strength.
Overall these transactions will help us
maximize our investments in these
businesses which have delivered strong
results across various market cycles and
provided excellent value to our policyowners.
Moves like these – and the
 opportunities they bring – are why I’m
so confident in MassMutual’s future. Still
one thing makes me most confident of
all: our people. We’ve always known
our strategy would only work if our
people are empowered to do their best.
So our approach is founded on one key
principle: people who are at their best in
life are at their best at work.
From fostering diversity and inclusion to
advancing continuous improvement and
learning we are putting our employees in the
best position to succeed. We did this in 2018 by
modernizing and expanding our benefits to give
our employees greater choice and flexibility
as well as announcing plans to expand our
presence in our home state – recommitting
to the city we have called home since our
founding and establishing a new Boston
campus. This will create an overall
environment that fosters greater
collaboration and innovation for
generations to come.
And finally investments like this are not just
limited to our workforce and workplace – they
extend to our communities as well. We achieved
major milestones on the way to improving the
places where we live and work from reaching

A Live Mutual Future
Taken together our ongoing progress puts us in
a strong position to continue what has driven
us since the beginning: helping people
secure their future and protect the
ones they love.
When I look back on the 168
years since MassMutual was
founded I take great pride in
knowing this purpose has always
been at the heart of how we see
the world and our place in it.
I am proud of the investments we have
 made in 2018 to help make living mutually a
reality for our policyowners and customers and
incredibly excited for what we will accomplish in
the new year and beyond.
Thank you for being part of the MassMutual
community. We look forward to working with you
to advance a future where we can all Live Mutual –
this year and for many years to come.

The ConocoPhillips team delivered another exceptional year in 2018. Our operational
performance drove strong financial results and generated sector-leading total
shareholder returns (TSR) of 16 percent. We view this strong TSR performance as
an endorsement of the disciplined returns-focused value proposition we launched
in late 2016.
At that time we implemented a strategy that we believe remains the right one for
the E&P sector. Although our business is opportunity-rich it’s also mature capitalintensive and cyclical. In embracing these realities we’ve led the industry in setting
clear priorities for how we’ll allocate cash to generate superior returns through cycles.
Designing a value proposition is one thing; delivering on it is another. Over the past two years we’ve taken
numerous actions to improve the underlying quality of our business. We’ve significantly lowered our sustaining
price and strengthened our balance sheet. We’ve grown our resource base with a cost of supply less than 40 per
barrel West Texas Intermediate. We’ve delivered competitive per-share growth not chased absolute growth.
We’ve returned a distinctive portion of cash flows to shareholders kept costs in check and generated one of our
industry’s most competitive financial returns. Our 2018 results demonstrate that our value proposition is working.
During the year ConocoPhillips achieved:
• Financial returns that surpassed the returns from just a few years ago when Brent prices averaged more than
50 percent higher;
• Cash from operations that exceeded capital spending by 5.5 billion;
• Higher-than-targeted production growth on a per debt-adjusted share basis;
• Debt reduction of 4.7 billion thus achieving our 15 billion total debt target 18 months early;
• 35 percent payout of cash from operations to shareholders via our dividend and 3 billion of share buybacks;
• Portfolio enhancements through exploration success and acquisitions in Alaska acreage additions in the Lower 48
and Canada and proceeds from non-core asset dispositions of 1.1 billion;
• 147 percent total reserve replacement and 109 percent organic reserve replacement excluding asset transactions;
• And year-end reserves of 5.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Importantly we delivered these milestones safely and sustainably while engaging with our many stakeholders. 2018
was a gratifying year and we’re excited about our opportunities in 2019. We’ll maintain our disciplined approach
with a 6.1 billion capital budget a focus on per-share growth an increasing dividend and 3 billion in planned
share buybacks for the third straight year. Operationally we’ll conduct exploration appraisal and development in
the Lower 48 Alaska Canada and Europe with major project decisions pending in China Australia and elsewhere.
We believe that our 2019 operating plan reflects what you’ve come to expect from us. It’s consistent with our
priorities focused on long-term value creation and underpinned by our commitment to strong execution. This is
our formula for delivering superior returns to shareholders through the cycles and for many years to come. Our
formula works and we’re sticking to it.
We appreciate our employees and shareholders for their ongoing support of ConocoPhillips.

a publicly traded partnership and our 50th anniversary since the formation of
our founding sponsor Enterprise Products Company (“EPCO”). We marked these
milestones by setting 23 operational and financial records in 2018. Our strong
performance was primarily from record NGLs crude oil and natural gas volumes
transported across our integrated pipeline system new assets put into service and
expansions of existing assets.
We also made significant progress in transitioning from the master limited
partnership (“MLP”) financial model which relies heavily on the equity capital
markets and continuous issuance of new equity to fund growth capital projects
to a more traditional model in financing our company. In 2018 we achieved
our goal of self-funding the equity portion or 50 percent of our growth capital
investments a year ahead of schedule. We believe self-funding our equity
investing in projects with attractive returns on capital and maintaining our
best-in-class balance sheet will enhance the value of the partnership units and
support cash flow per unit growth.
This stronger financial position enabled our general partner’s board of directors
to authorize a 2 billion multi-year common unit buyback program which
provides us another “tool in the toolbox” to return capital to our investors in
addition to distribution growth. Our management also provided guidance for
distributions to be declared with respect to 2019 of 1.765 per unit or a 2.3 percent
increase compared to 2018. This guidance is based on management’s current
expectations and the distribution with respect to each quarter of 2019 is subject to
management’s final recommendation to and approval by the board of directors.

RECORD PERFORMANCE
Enterprise reported a 29 percent increase in total gross operating margin to a
record 7.3 billion compared to 2017 with each of our four business segments
reporting increases. We reported net income attributable to limited partners for
2018 of 4.2 billion or 1.91 per unit on a fully diluted basis which represents a
47 percent increase compared to 1.30 per unit on a fully diluted basis for 2017.
Net cash flow provided by operating activities (“CFFO”) for 2018 increased 31
percent to a record 6.1 billion. Distributions to limited partners declared with
respect to 2018 were 3.8 billion or 62 percent of CFFO. Free cash flow for 2018
increased 50 percent to a record 2.0 billion compared to 2017.
In terms of MLP financial measures Enterprise’s strong performance led to
record DCF of 5.8 billion excluding proceeds from asset sales and monetization
of interest rate derivatives. This level of DCF enabled us to increase the cash
distributions we paid to our partners for 2018 by 2.5 percent when compared to
comparable declarations for 2017 and provided a solid 1.5 times coverage of 2018
distributions. We retained 2.2 billion of DCF which allowed us to self-fund the
equity portion of our growth capital investments of 4.2 billion.
Enterprise has increased its cash distribution rate for 20 consecutive years or
every year since its initial public offering (“IPO”) in 1998. Since our IPO we have
paid 31 billion in total cash distributions while retaining more than 14 billion or
31 percent of total DCF to reinvest in the partnership. Total gross operating margin
free cash flow and DCF are Non-GAAP financial measures that are defined and
reconciled later in this letter to investors.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
In 2018 we completed construction began commercial activities or ramped up
volumes on assets totaling more than 5 billion of capital investment. These new
assets include our PDH facility Midland-to-ECHO 1 crude oil pipeline ninth NGL
fractionator at our Mont Belvieu-area complex and two natural gas processing
plants serving the Delaware Basin of the Permian. Due to growing global demand
for PGP we are in discussions with several customers for the development of a
second PDH facility.
Our Midland-to-ECHO 1 pipeline is currently transporting approximately 570
thousand barrels per day (“MBPD”) of Permian crude oil to domestic and export
markets on the Texas Gulf Coast under long-term fee-based contracts. We are in
the process of completing a cost effective expansion that will increase the capacity
to 620 MBPD.
Another notable achievement in 2018 included our loading the first VLCC at a Texas
port. A VLCC has a 75-foot draft and can transport two million barrels of crude oil.
To more efficiently and economically export U.S. crude we filed an application in
January 2019 with the Maritime Administration (“MARAD”) to build an offshore port
in water deep enough to fully load a VLCC without the need for reverse lightering.
Our proposed Sea Port Oil Terminal would be able to load a tanker at 85000 barrels
per hour giving us the capability to load a two million barrel VLCC in 24 hours.
The final investment decision on this project is subject to obtaining the requisite
regulatory approvals and sufficient long-term fee-based contracts.
In September 2018 we jointly announced with CME Group a pilot program for
a new WTI Houston Crude Oil futures contract with three delivery points on
Enterprise’s system. Our Houston-area distribution network offers unmatched
connectivity via an extensive network of pipelines storage facilities and marine
terminals with access to more than 4 million BPD of crude oil supply from the
major producing basins in the U.S. and Canada making it an ideal pricing point.
WTI Houston Crude Oil futures began listing with the January 2019 contract
month. CME Group is the owner and operator of the largest commodities futures
exchanges including the New York Mercantile Exchange.
CURRENT MACRO ENERGY OUTLOOK
Global demand for crude oil NGLs and natural gas continues to increase driven by
economic growth initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the desire by
developing countries to upgrade their standards of living. Production from U.S. shale
resources is playing an important role in supplying this growth while contributing
to lower energy prices to the end use consumer. The International Energy Agency
(“IEA”) recently reported that global demand for crude oil and NGLs grew by a
combined 1.3 million BPD in 2018; and expects demand to grow by 1.4 million BPD
in 2019.
With production more than double domestic demand the U.S. has become the
largest exporter of liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) in the world. LPG is comprised
of propane and butane. The majority of the demand growth has come from many
developing countries promoting cleaner fuels such as propane to replace coal and
wood which reduces emissions and deforestation. Government-sponsored programs
to promote LPG usage have been successful in countries such as China India
Indonesia and Nigeria.
U.S. exports of natural gas have increased by approximately 100 percent since
2015 as the result of five billion cubic feet per day (“Bcf/d”) of U.S. liquefied
natural gas (“LNG”) facilities commencing operations. Most of these LNG export
cargoes are serving markets in Asia and Europe to fuel new power generation
facilities or displace coal at existing power plants to reduce emissions and
improve air quality. As an example from 2007 to 2017 the U.S. reduced its CO2
emissions 14 percent by increasing its usage of natural gas for power generation
in combination with renewable energy.
With respect to the domestic petrochemical industry abundant supplies of
shale-sourced ethane provide the U.S. with one of the cheapest feedstocks
available for ethylene production. The American Chemistry Council estimates
the petrochemical industry is investing over 200 billion to expand U.S. chemical
production with most of the investments tied directly to producing ethylene from
cost-advantaged ethane.
International demand for U.S. ethane is also expected to remain robust in 2019 as
production from domestic shale basins offers the global petrochemical industry a
low-cost feedstock option and supply diversification.
Finally as U.S. crude oil production increases exports continue to replace
imports with most of the barrels destined for markets in Central and South
America Asia and Western Europe where the lighter U.S. crudes are refined.
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS
We begin 2019 with 6.7 billion of growth capital projects under construction.
We also have a number of infrastructure projects under development that
should result in the announcement of additional growth capital projects. These
new projects provide additional visibility to future cash flow growth. The major
projects under construction or recently completed include:

n Conversion of one EPD Seminole NGL pipeline to crude oil service
The Midland-to-ECHO 2 pipeline began limited service in February 2019 and is
scheduled to begin full commercial service with approximately 200 MBPD of
transportation capacity in April 2019. Supported by a 10.75-year agreement this
pipeline will add much needed capacity to move crude oil from the Permian Basin
to markets in the Houston area.
n Shin Oak NGL pipeline
The 658-mile 24-inch diameter pipeline will add 550 MBPD of NGL
transportation capacity from the Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu. It began limited
service in February 2019 transporting NGLs from our new Orla gas plants and
NGLs diverted as a result of the conversion of one EPD Seminole NGL pipeline
to crude service as well as other third party NGLs. The Shin Oak pipeline is
also supported by a dedication from Apache Corporation for all of their NGL
production from the Alpine High development.
n Third Orla and Mentone natural gas processing plants
The third natural gas processing plant at our Orla Complex in the Delaware Basin
is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2019 and the Mentone
processing plant is scheduled to begin service in the first quarter of 2020. Upon
completion of these facilities the partnership will have approximately 1.6 Bcf/d of
natural gas processing capacity and 250 MBPD of NGL production capacity in the
Permian (Delaware Basin).
n Two new NGL fractionators at Mont Belvieu Complex
We began construction on two NGL fractionators adjacent to our Mont Belvieu
complex that will add 300 MBPD of much needed capacity to handle the increased
volume of NGLs expected from the Permian Basin. Upon completion in 2020 our
NGL fractionation capacity at the Mont Belvieu complex will be approximately
1.1 million BPD.
n New ethylene export terminal
We have formed a joint venture to build an ethylene export terminal along the
U.S. Gulf Coast with the capacity to export approximately one million tons of
ethylene per year. Supporting the joint venture will be associated dock storage
and pipeline assets. The facility will support growing U.S. ethylene production by
providing producers the flexibility to access international markets rather than
relying solely on the export of derivative products such as polyethylene. The
ethylene export terminal is expected to begin limited commercial operations in
the fourth quarter of 2019.
SAFETY ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

With our unrivaled scale and scope Nike is able to listen to the voices of athletes in every corner of the planet. And as we step back and reflect on the big picture we see something incredible: a world with billions of athletes united in the joy of movement.

The power of sport has never been more profound. People everywhere want to lead healthier lives; in fact between the U.S. and China over 500 million people are active at least once a week. On the heels of a thrilling World Cup and with the NBA's growing global popularity passion for sport is surging. Meanwhile streaming and social media are changing the way we consume sport content—bringing billions of consumers closer to the leagues and athletes they love. And over two billion digital natives in markets like China India and Latin America will join the middle class by 2030.

At the same time the nature of shopping is changing. In this mobile-led world consumers have limitless choices. They vote for distinctive cutting-edge products. They expect fast and frictionless service. And they see no trade-off between sport and style.

Added up it means there's a world of opportunity for Nike. The growing demand for sports the embrace of active lifestyles and demographic changes are tailwinds for our business. And with our unparalleled product innovation pipeline brand strength and digitized supply chain these trends play to our strengths.

Passion for sport 
is growing around 
the world.

CONSUMER DIRECT OFFENSE
To turn global shifts into global growth this year we aligned to the Consumer Direct Offense—allowing us to serve athletes personally at scale. It places more focus on the opportunities with the greatest returns from redefining the North America retail landscape to accelerating our international momentum. It brings to life our Triple Double strategy which places a deeper focus on three core areas—Innovation Direct and Speed—that are igniting the next phase of growth and profitability for Nike.

These changes represent more than a step forward—they are catalysts for transformation. FY18 was a milestone year setting the stage for our future.

To deliver on our ambitions we've defined new measures of success. For example over the next five years we expect more than 50% of our growth to originate from new innovation concepts that will scale across multiple categories. We expect that digital revenue both owned and through partners will increase from nearly 15% today to over 30%; and nearly 75% of our growth will come from our international geographies.

Just a year into the Consumer Direct Offense we’re building momentum. Across the board it has made a tremendous impact. In FY18…

Nike React 
is making waves across 
sport and style.

NIKE Inc. revenues grew 6% to 36.4 billion on a reported basis. On a currency-neutral basis NIKE Inc. revenues grew 4%.
Sportswear is now a 10 billion business that’s growing rapidly and our Performance categories are catalyzing new consumer energy with distinctive innovation.
For the full year international geographies accounted for over 100% of our growth led by Greater China—which grew 21%.
And our largest geography North America returned to healthy and sustainable growth.
2X INNOVATION
The Triple Double puts more firepower behind what we’re known for: performance innovation that elevates the potential of every athlete everywhere.

Fueled by the Triple Double we’re leading with platforms not just products. But we didn’t only unveil several groundbreaking platforms—we scaled them faster than ever.

Running our largest Performance category experienced strong growth last year. Nike React is living up to big expectations making waves across multiple sports and styles. With its combination of light weight streamlined style and energy return the Epic React is already one of the top performance running shoes in the marketplace.

The Pegasus 35 with a new full-length articulated Zoom Air had the highest first-season bookings of any Peg in our history. And at the London Marathon winner Eliud Kipchoge debuted Flyprint our latest peak performance technology. As the first 3D-printed textile upper in performance footwear Flyprint works in concert with ZoomX foam—allowing designers to translate athlete data into new textile geometries.

Kevin Durant 
won his second straight 
NBA Finals MVP.

In Basketball our first full year in partnership with the NBA was special—igniting energy for our Brand and new demand for signature styles. New products like the Showtime Hoodie and “Editions” jerseys drove impressive results.

On our SNKRS app the “LeBron Watch” feature turned LeBron’s on-court footwear debuts into real-time buying opportunities. And best of all our NBA partnership is driving global excitement: in Greater China for example Nike Basketball is growing faster than in any other geography.

At the World Cup Nike made a statement on one of the biggest stages in sport. At a time when footballers are more influential than ever over 60% of the players in the opening round wore Nike boots. One of our signature teams France prevailed in the all-Nike final match—the world's most widely viewed sporting event. Nike stars exceeded expectations with France's Kylian Mbappé winning the award for best young player; Croatia's Luka Modric being named best overall player; and England's Harry Kane earning the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals. Looking ahead we're poised to sustain our growth in the world's most popular sport. We recently entered into a 10-year partnership with the China Super League one of the fastest-growing football nations in the world.

The dynamism of our Performance categories feeds into the strength of Sportswear. With the rising popularity of active lifestyles Sportswear is about bringing comfort and style to every facet of the consumer's life.

That starts with Air Max one of the fastest-growing platforms in our industry. The Air Max 270 became the most-successful launch in the platform's history and the Air Max's heritage styles continue to have strong momentum. The VaporMax is moving from running tracks to runways headlined by the VaporMax Plus and VaporMax 97. And to create local energy in key cities around the world we held Nike: On Air a sneaker design program that empowered consumers to imagine an Air Max inspired by their community's unique cultural fingerprint. Beyond Air Sportswear's growth is a reflection of our integrated offense.

React is scaling into the category with a series of casual silhouettes that offer all-day energy. With head-to-toe looks that pair with popular sneaker styles demand for Tech Fleece continues to grow rapidly. And powered by a holistic approach across Running Training and Sportswear our Women's business is building momentum. Lifestyle product led the way with headlines like our 1 Reimagined collection—which remixed our iconic Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1. In addition with new collections that tap into sneaker culture for women Jordan Brand nearly tripled the size of its women's sneakers business last year.

Our Women’s business 
is building momentum 
fueled by complete 
collections for her.

2X DIRECT
Just as we're developing groundbreaking platforms across style and performance we're breaking down the barrier between physical and digital retail. That starts with the cornerstone of our 2X Direct strategy: expanding membership.

In FY18 we exceeded all of our membership targets—adding new members heightening engagement and improving conversion. We improved our app ecosystem both geographically and through new capabilities. And most importantly we invested deeply in data and analytics—allowing us to serve consumers both online and in store with exactly what they need.

We're expanding SNKRS the world's #1 footwear shopping app. Home to the most engaged sneaker audience on the planet SNKRS has become the go-to destination for high heat product launches.

We're also transforming the NIKE app into a real-world destination. In select stores consumers can use their phones to access a host of new features—like product reservations the ability to scan product to learn more and skipping lines with self-checkout.

Stars like 
Kylian Mbappé 
headlined an all-Nike 
World Cup Final.

What's more through a new store concept called Nike Live we're bringing to life our vision of localized data-driven retail. As the physical manifestation of our entire digital ecosystem the store's location and assortment are chosen by leveraging data on local buying patterns and app engagement.

2X SPEED
The work we do in 2X Direct is designed to exceed consumer expectations and a big part of that depends on our progress with 2X Speed. By digitizing our supply chain from end-to-end we're amplifying our ability to sense the market drive efficiency and manufacture more sustainably. As part of that in FY18 we invested significantly in the capabilities that will make us more nimble—so we can serve athletes with what they want when they want it.

There's no better example of that than the Express Lane our fast-acting product engine. Express Lane quickly creates new concepts like the Mercurial TN which was inspired by the World Cup. Express Lane also updates popular models with new materials and colors based on real-time consumer insights and restocks stores in as fast as two days. It means we're exceeding the expectations of mobile-first consumers—and capitalizing on trends in the moment. Express Lane as a whole is leading to significantly stronger full-price sell-through rates and better overall supply-demand management.

PURPOSE MOVES US
Ultimately our momentum comes down to something bigger than any single product service or technology. In this time of relentless change our success is grounded in staying true to our purpose: using the power of sport to move the world forward.

Because our aim is to elevate human potential—and because we have the brand scale and resources to make a global impact—we're counted on to lead. We embrace that opportunity.

But living up to our purpose is about more than words—it's about reflecting it in every facet of our company. That starts first and foremost by cultivating an environment of respect and inclusion within Nike.

This past year we became aware of behaviors inconsistent with our values. This doesn't reflect the Nike I've known for nearly 40 years. We are committed to building and sustaining a strong culture—because as a company fueled by creativity nothing is more important than being able to share different perspectives.

The iconic 
Air Max platform 
continues to power the 
growth of Sportswear.

As part of that commitment we took immediate and decisive action. We are rolling out an array of initiatives that will create the kind of workplace environment we need to achieve our ambitious goals. Fostering an open and accountable culture is the key to unlocking our potential and continues to be our top priority.

This is just the first step in a bigger journey. This year we released our FY16/17 Sustainable Business Report. It articulates our belief in a fair sustainable future—one where everyone thrives on a healthy planet and a level playing field.

To make that vision a reality we're bringing sport back into kids' lives because the kids who move do better in their classrooms careers and communities. We are building a diverse and inclusive team that represents the billions of athletes we serve. And we're pioneering technologies business models and partnerships—ensuring that supply chains are green equitable and fair and our materials and products are sustainable.

Taken together it will add up to achieving the most important goal Nike's ever had: leaving a positive footprint on the planet.

LOOKING AHEAD
Through the Consumer Direct Offense we've sharpened our focus around the consumer's expectations—prioritizing innovation speed and direct connections. We closed out the fiscal year with a strong performance across our business. Still we have significant opportunity ahead and work to do to continue to build on that momentum.

Every idea we have…every service we develop…and every innovation platform we create—all stem from the same source: the voice of the athlete. And with our unrivaled global presence brand strength and innovation in data we know athletes better than ever.

Serena Williams continues to 
break barriers 
and make history.

To serve today's athlete we're combining the agility of a local business with the scale of a global brand. Like never before we're able to envision—and then deliver—the future of sport.

We aim for nothing less. Because at Nike our mission is bold: to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.

2018 summarized.
In 2018 we achieved sales of 36.1 billion a 4.4 percent increase over 2017. Net earnings in 2018 were 2.4 billion
up 3.9 percent from 2017. Earnings per share increased to 3.28 from 3.04 the previous year. Net earnings and
earnings per share were negatively impacted by a new accounting standard that requires us to measure our
investments in equity securities at fair value and recognize the unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair
value in earnings. Net earnings and earnings per share also were positively impacted by the decrease in the federal
statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective in 2018 due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
(Tax Act). Additionally net earnings and earnings per share for 2017 were positively impacted by a one time
remeasurement of deferred income taxes related to the Tax Act. Without the impact of the new accounting standard
in 2018 and the one time remeasurement of deferred income taxes in 2017 our net earnings for 2018 would have
been 2.5 billion a 21.8 percent increase compared to 2.1 billion in 2017 and earnings per share for 2018 would
have been 3.47 compared to 2.74 per share in 2017. As of March 1 2019 our stock price was 42.85 as
compared to 41.40 on March 1 2018.
We also continued to invest in our stores. In 2018 we opened 51 new stores and closed seven for a net gain of 44.
We also remodeled 146 stores. Because we show our customers how important they are they give us their loyalty by
continuing to shop with us. That’s why we were ranked No. 88 on the Fortune 100 list. Delivering premier customer
service remains our top priority. We continue to find ways to focus on serving our customers where they are and
where they are going.
Our leaders set the example.
Great leaders help our associates understand expectations and they understand the value of investing in our
associates and building relationships. Developing our team for tomorrow is a critical part of what we do. I want to
thank our current leaders as they continue to pave the way for those who will follow them.

Most stockholders can now access their Publix stock account information through Publix Stockholder Online (PSO).
You can view your account balance certificate detail dividend payment history and tax documents. You can also
sign up for or manage direct deposit for dividends change your mailing address and manage your online delivery
preferences.
As stockholders it can be a challenge to keep up with your paper stock certificates. So last year we made managing
your certificates easier by issuing e-certificates and providing account statements. This has been an industry
standard for some time and we’re excited to offer this convenience. If you haven’t already exchanged your paper
stock certificates for electronic ones log in to your PSO account on corporate.publix.com/stock to learn how.
We continue to find ways to help our associates stay up to date on what’s happening at Publix and update their
personal information with Publix. Last year we gave our internal website a new look and feel. Now our associates
can check their schedules update information enroll in benefits access company news and more — all from their
phones. This is the first step in connecting with our associates on the devices they use every day.
Growth is an investment in our future.
Last year was an exciting year of announcements surrounding growth and new jobs.
In the fall we opened our new-format GreenWise Market in Tallahassee Florida and we announced locations in
Boca Raton Florida; Fort Lauderdale Florida; Lakeland Florida; Lexington South Carolina; Marietta Georgia;
Mount Pleasant South Carolina; Mountain Brook Alabama; Nocatee (Ponte Vedra Beach) Florida; and Odessa
Florida. You can continue to look for additional locations at greenwisemarket.com.
In order to help meet our needs as we continue to grow we plan to build a new distribution center in Greensboro
North Carolina. Phase one of the project — a refrigerated distribution center — is expected to create 600 new jobs
by 2022 and will support the delivery of grocery products to stores in the Carolinas and Virginia. The refrigerated
distribution center is part of a proposed multiphase project that would create up to 1000 jobs once it’s complete.
3
With the growth we’ve experienced since moving into our new corporate office in 2002 we have more than
exceeded the building’s capacity. The time has come to expand our corporate office and as part of this expansion
we will be adding 700 additional jobs by the end of 2027 to support our store growth. Associates are expected to
begin moving into the expansion at the end of 2020.
Services offer convenience to our customers.
It’s been two years since we launched grocery delivery — offering same-day grocery delivery to our customers
through Instacart. I’m excited to share delivery is available in all of our operating area including liquor delivery in
Florida. We have also expanded our curbside pickup test to more than 20 stores. You can drive to select stores to
pick up your groceries without leaving your car. Take advantage of either service by going to publix.com/shop or
downloading our Publix Delivery app.
We continue to develop new customer payment options. This year we began rolling out the ability to pay online
when ordering subs cakes and platters online for in-store pickup. We are also piloting the ability to pay for your
groceries at the register with the Publix app. You would add a payment option to your Publix account and scan the
QR code to pay for your items and apply any digital services you use like coupons and e-receipts. Mobile pay is a
convenience our customers expect. If you haven’t already download the Publix app and experience how we’re
helping our customers save time and money.
Last spring we began offering BayCareAnywhereTM doctors in our pharmacies through a Walk-in Care telehealth
center. The center provides non-urgent medical care for minor medical concerns by connecting you to a boardcertified physician through a video conference system. It’s equipped with a variety of medical tools to help aid
diagnosis and then prescriptions can be filled in our pharmacy. These are operated in 20 pharmacies throughout
Hillsborough Pasco Pinellas and Polk counties in Florida.
Last year we began offering a new immunization through our pharmacies — Shingrix a two-dose vaccine available
to help protect against Shingles.
Recognitions honor our commitment to our Publix family.
We are so passionate about serving our associates our customers and our communities that industry organizations
have honored us with awards and recognitions. I’ve included some of them below.
• New! Fortune’s Best Big Companies to Work For

In the face of difficult times we stand together.
Last year’s hurricane season affected our Publix family in the Carolinas and the Florida Panhandle. Hurricanes
Florence and Michael caused devastation that will take years to rebuild from. To help with recovery Publix
associates and customers gave more than 1.5 million to American Red Cross (ARC) through our disaster relief
register program. Publix Charities donated 500000 to ARC and United Way.
We are connecting with the hearts and minds of people everywhere.
Being responsible citizens in our communities is more than a point in our mission statement; it’s part of the fiber of
who we are.
The following associates help set the bar for giving back by being recognized with the Mr. George Community
Service Award — Doug Anglin Rachel Buchanan Roderika Curtis Greta Dupuy Emily Madak and Kevin Piper.
In April more than 5700 associates participated in our fourth annual Publix Serves Day volunteering at more than
150 local nonprofit organizations whose focus is primarily on the plight of the hungry and homeless. You can see
what we’re doing in the community on social media by following #PublixServes.
Our giving goes beyond an annual Publix Serves Day. Every year we also support several organizations through our
corporate campaign programs. Last year we remained No. 1 in corporate giving nationally for the March of Dimes
raising more than 7.5 million. We donated 65.3 million to United Way between the 38.7 million from associate
pledges and 26.6 million from the Publix Charities matching gift. We also raised money for Special Olympics
(over 5.9 million) and Children’s Miracle Network (over 5.7 million).
Also in an effort to help alleviate hunger Publix Charities announced it would donate 5 million to Feeding
America member food banks schools and other nonprofit organizations focused on alleviating hunger across
Publix’s operating area. Over the past four years Publix Charities has contributed more than 17 million to
hunger-related programs.
According to the USDA more than 41 million Americans live in food-insecure households including nearly
13 million children and 5 million seniors. To help make a difference we support food banks and agencies in the
Feeding America network through our in-store perishable recovery program. Last year we added more products
from the meat department and began piloting the expansion of deli products. Since the program started more than
10 years ago we’ve donated more than 482 million pounds of perishable food representing more than 400 million
meals.

We take care of our people and the planet.
Whether it’s promoting our associate wellness program or planting seedlings in preservation areas being dedicated
to doing what’s right is part of what we do. If you want to learn more about our efforts visit publix.com/sustainability.
Building relationships is part of the Publix difference.
Our focus areas and business initiatives all support the concept of developing relationships. What causes our
customers to drive by the competition to shop in our stores? It’s because of the relationships our associates have
developed with their customers. Why do our communities count on our support time and time again? It’s because of
the commitment we’ve shown them in good times and in tough times. Building relationships is critical to our
success and because we have amazing people who make a difference every time they come to work I’m excited for
what’s ahead of us.
Thank you for all you do.

Fellow Stakeholders
Our continued focus on improving customer service
across our business meeting demand for clean
and affordable energy and partnering with our
communities to deliver a smart next-generation
energy grid allowed us to accelerate execution
of our strategy in 2018. Once again we delivered
strong financial results and are well positioned for
stable growth.
Our progress has been driven by several factors including:
• Industry recognized operational performance and a
customer-focused investment strategy across our six electric
companies contributing to favorable regulatory outcomes
and continued earnings growth;
• A drive to reduce costs while continuing to seek out and
invest in the technology infrastructure and innovations that
will advance the next-generation energy grid;
• A focus on maximizing the value of our clean generation
fleet through operational excellence and advocacy for state
and federal policies that recognize the environmental and
reliability benefits of nuclear energy; and
• Dedication to developing the workforce of the future and
contributing our time and resources to help build stronger
communities everywhere we operate.
These foundational principles comprise the core of our value
proposition and continue to guide each of our investment
decisions. The result has been three years of outperforming the
utility sector and a total shareholder return of 18 percent in the
midst of industry uncertainty and market volatility.
We see clear opportunities for continued growth by building on
our commitment to understanding what our customers want and
expect from us: A future built on affordable reliable and clean
energy. Exelon is moving on multiple fronts to meet that demand.
We are investing in technology and infrastructure to increase
reliability and give customers more tools to control energy costs.
Our generation fleet with the lowest carbon emissions of any
large generator accounts for one of every nine carbon-free
electrons flowing on the grid today – more than twice as much
as any other generator. Our talented diverse and dedicated
employees drive our success in both operating performance and
our recognized role as an essential community partner and civic
leader. Those components add up to strong sustainable value
for shareholders and stakeholders.
“We see clear
opportunities for
continued growth
by building on our
commitment to
understanding what
our customers want
and expect from us:
A future built on
affordable reliable
and clean energy.”

“A key contributor

performance — and
to your continued
confidence in
us — is the work

management and
business process
transformation.”
Financial Performance
Exelon sustained strong financial performance throughout the
year. Our stock price closed 2018 at 45.10 up 14.4 percent
for the year compared with the S&P at (6.2%) and the UTY at
(0.2%). It has continued to post gains since the start of the year.
Adjusted operating (non-GAAP) earnings came in at 3.12 per
share at the midpoint of our revised guidance range.*
 In addition
we raised the dividend early in the year by 5 percent. Our balance
sheet remains strong as evidenced by S&P and Fitch’s recent
upgrade decision based on the successful execution of growth
strategy and focus on regulated utility investments.
A key contributor to financial performance — and to your
continued confidence in us — is the work accomplished in cost
management and business process transformation. Our record
on cost reduction now stands at more than 900 million since
2015 and these savings will continue to drive future earnings.
Importantly all our cost decisions have been based on sound
fundamentals that contribute to our long-term strategic
priorities not short-term cuts.
Federal tax reform was also a strong driver for cash and earnings
and also translated into customer savings. Exelon was one of the
first to execute a plan to return tax savings to utility customers
resulting in savings of 675 million annually; clearly the right
thing to do.
Our GAAP earnings were 2.07 per diluted share in 2018
compared with 3.99 in 2017. On an adjusted operating
(non-GAAP) basis our earnings increased to 3.12 per diluted
share in 2018 from 2.62 in 2017. The 0.50 increase in
non-GAAP operating earnings primarily reflects the favorable
impacts of regulatory rate increases and weather conditions
at Exelon’s utilities and the favorable impacts of New York and
Illinois Zero Emissions Credit revenue and tax savings related to
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the Generation business partially
offset by lower realized energy prices in the Generation business.

Delivering Value
Exelon Utilities moved forward on all fronts to maintain
operational excellence enhance regulatory outcomes provide
the foundation for enterprise-wide growth and become the utility
of the future. We invested 5.5 billion primarily in infrastructure
and technology to provide a premium customer experience and
improved reliability. That investment increased our rate base by
3 billion (8.7%) setting the foundation for continued growth.
Exelon Utilities in aggregate earned 9.7 percent in 2018 solidly
within our target range and achieved positive results in multiple
regulatory rate reviews. This was especially true in some of
our PHI jurisdictions where regulatory rate reviews resulted in
settlements for the first time in decades.
We are committed to a Connected Communities strategy and
have secured some important supporting policy wins. Pepco was
successful in pursuing legislation in the District of Columbia that
gives the company an important role in advancing the adoption
of electric vehicles and allows it to earn a return on its energy
efficiency programs and investments. The Maryland Public
Service Commission also has endorsed an important role for
our utilities in promoting electric vehicles and investing in the
associated infrastructure. Pennsylvania enacted legislation that
allows PECO to pursue alternative regulatory models such as
formula rates and ComEd is preparing a significant legislative
initiative in Illinois to strengthen the regulatory model.
Our continuing modernization investments have produced
significant gains in reliability and in turn customer satisfaction.
Customer satisfaction ranked in the top quartile at three of four
utilities and we achieved first quartile results on more than half
of our customer operating metrics. A key contributor to our
success was continued investment in grid and gas infrastructure
modernization at all our utilities. This investment program has
placed three of our states in the top 10 of the GridWise Alliance’s
grid modernization scorecard with Illinois at No. 2 Maryland
at No. 3 and the District at No. 9. All our remaining jurisdictions
scored in the top half of the scorecard.
From an operating perspective our utilities continue to perform
at an exceptionally high level. All four of our utilities ended in the
top quartile in outage frequency performance. Each achieved top
quartile performance for outage duration with the exception of
PECO which narrowly missed top quartile by one minute. This level
of reliability demonstrates that the investments we are making in
our system are yielding positive results for our customers.

Generating Clean Energy
Exelon Generation remains focused on cash flow capital
allocation and debt management through active asset
management and optimization. Nuclear fleet valuation remains
a critical focus and we are acting on several fronts. Oyster Creek
was retired as planned in September after an outstanding
run of 439 days without an outage. In May 2017 we announced
that absent policy and price support in Pennsylvania we would
retire TMI-1 in fall 2019. Legislation was recently introduced in
Pennsylvania that would amend the state’s Alternative Energy
Portfolio Standard to include nuclear as a qualifying resource
and lawmakers in Illinois introduced new legislation to maintain
progress on preserving clean energy including nuclear and
promote the growth of renewables. We remain hopeful that
these measures will become law and provide continued support
for nuclear energy in the Commonwealth and Illinois. West
Medway a 195 MW gas peaking project in Massachusetts is
nearing commercial operation. The Net Power demonstration
plant is also very close to initial synchronization to the grid
with full-scale testing currently underway. The project secured
a key investment from Occidental Petroleum and continues to
demonstrate strong promise for future growth.
The Constellation Wholesale team effectively managed the
power and gas portfolio through a period of seasonal volatility
and we performed well in various load auctions. Constellation
Retail continued to experience compressed margins in power
but held market share and recorded strong customer renewals
in a hyper-competitive retail environment. Constellation
made major strides in business process transformation and
cost management as part of their ongoing efforts to manage
challenging market conditions.
Generation fleet operations remained at industry-leading levels.
Exelon Power’s gas and hydro dispatch match and wind/solar
energy capture exceeded goal. The nuclear fleet set a record for
generation output with a capacity factor of 94.6 percent and
strong refueling outage execution.

Advocating for a Clean Energy Future
Our customers and other stakeholders in the communities we serve have made clear that they
want us to be active partners in efforts to address the threat posed by climate change. We continue
to advocate for policies on the state and federal level that preserve and expand all forms of clean
energy and address acknowledged market flaws that fail to properly value the environmental and
economic benefits of nuclear energy which accounts for more than 60 percent of our nation’s
zero-carbon energy.
Zero Emissions Credit programs in Illinois and New York are working to secure nuclear plants
preventing increased electricity costs to customers and helping those states meet their
carbon-reduction goals. Both programs prevailed in federal appellate court challenges and the
revenue they provide contributed to our financial results in 2018. A similar program has been
implemented in New Jersey and will support the continued operation of the Salem nuclear plant.
In Massachusetts we received positive decisions by the New England Independent System
Operator and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to authorize a cost of service agreement
that will enable our Mystic gas-powered generation units supported by the acquisition of the
Everett Marine Terminal to continue providing fuel security to the New England market for two
additional years.
“We continue to advocate for policies on

Building a Strong Workforce and
Sustainable Communities
At Exelon we know that diverse teams foster innovation
and deliver stronger results both in our business and in the
communities we serve. We have taken a series of effective
actions to continue our progress on diversity and inclusion
including active participation in the UN HeForShe campaign and
aggressive investment in science technology engineering and
math (STEM) education programs in our communities. We have
been widely recognized for these initiatives most recently as one
of the best employers for diversity by Forbes Black Enterprise
Magazine DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign.
Reinforcing the mandate for inclusiveness and the primacy of
respect in today’s workplace has been and will continue to be a
priority of the entire Exelon leadership team.
Exelon’s expenditures with diverse suppliers grew to 2.2 billion
in 2018 a 10 percent increase over 2017; and Exelon was
honored as one of Minority Business News magazine’s “Best
of the Decade” for our unwavering commitment to minority
business development and inclusion through our supply chain.
Last year was also another record-breaking year for employee
contributions and volunteerism as well as corporate
philanthropy. Volunteer hours employee giving matching
gifts and participation all exceeded goals. Our reputation for
community service in each of our localities is strong and our
employees feel an especially strong sense of connection through
their service.
The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) recently announced that
Exelon and AES are the only two U.S. electric utilities to score
at the leadership level on the 2018 global CDP Climate Change
Survey and we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index for the 13th year in a row. Finally Fast Company named
Exelon as one of its World’s Most Innovative Companies for
2019. This is a tribute to our commitment to staying ahead of our
customers’ expectations and to the creativity and engagement
of our employees always looking for a better way.

2018 was a year of solid execution for Plains. We exceeded our financial targets for the year and
realized year-over-year improvement in our safety and environmental programs while advancing
several key initiatives including our deleveraging plan our Permian-focused capital program and
multiple commercial and operational initiatives.
Market Environment
2018 was a year with generally favorable fundamentals supporting our business versus the previous
three years of relative cyclical lows. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices averaged 65
and average U.S. onshore horizontal rig count increased more than 20% versus 2017. Crude oil
production grew in every basin in which we have a meaningful presence. Production growth and
limited pipeline takeaway capacity in key basins caused crude oil location differentials to remain
volatile particularly in the Permian Basin and Canada. As a result absolute differentials in these
areas averaged significantly higher than in 2017 and provided incremental profit opportunities for
our Supply & Logistics (S&L) segment.
Plains’ 2018 Performance
We met exceeded or made meaningful progress on each of our goals for the year which included:
1. Run a safe reliable and responsible operation
2. Meet or exceed 2018 operating and financial guidance
3. Progress deleveraging plan return to targeted credit metrics by early 2019
4. Execute new projects to capture Permian growth opportunities further enhancing PAA’s
positioning for 2019 and beyond.
PAA reported 2018 Adjusted Net Income Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) per
Common Unit of approximately 1.57 billion 2.68 billion and 2.46 per common unit respectively.
We exceeded our beginning-of-the-year expectations in each metric beating our Adjusted EBITDA
guidance by approximately 380 million or more than 16% with DCF per unit exceeding our guidance
by more than 20%. This performance was underpinned by 10% year-over-year growth in our feebased business and meaningful over-performance in our margin-based S&L segment. This strong
1
performance reflects proactive teamwork to accelerate certain pipeline projects and safely achieve
higher utilization rates on key pipeline assets. These efforts across the U.S. and Canada combined
with record levels of throughput on certain of our assets enabled us to benefit from regional location
differentials particularly in the second half of the year.
Additionally we made meaningful progress on our deleveraging plan throughout the year through a
combination of efforts that reduced debt and increased cash flow while funding an expanded capital
program. Notably we completed asset sales of approximately 1.3 billion during the year (versus
a target of 700 million). As a result of the cumulative benefit of these efforts we exited the year
with a long-term debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio slightly favorable to the low end of our historical
target range of 3.5x-4.0x and with approximately 2.9 billion of committed liquidity. Furthermore
our outlook was revised from negative to stable on our Investment Grade credit ratings with S&P
and Fitch.
2018 was a solid year of execution on our capital program. In total we invested nearly 1.9 billion on
our Permian-focused organic growth capital program placing multiple key projects into service on
time or ahead of schedule while securing additional commitments on our Permian gathering assets.
We also advanced several key commercial initiatives including developing a new large-diameter
Permian pipeline joint venture with ExxonMobil and progressing a potential Capline reversal in
tandem with a potential expansion and extension of our Diamond pipeline. These and other projects
we are pursuing should enable us to continue to participate in North American production growth
supporting future fee-based cash flow growth visibility.
Looking Forward
We believe we are well positioned for the future. Supply and demand fundamentals for the North
American midstream energy business remain constructive. Worldwide need for energy continues
to expand and North America is expected to grow production to meet this need. We have a strong
competitive position in many key producing basins with our largest asset footprint located in the
Permian Basin one of the largest and most rapidly growing basins in the world.
Despite strong industry fundamentals several challenges remain. These include near-term uncertainty
regarding the rate of production growth due to the impact of a meaningful crude oil price decrease
in late 2018; a continuation of a highly competitive market for new midstream infrastructure which
may lead to an over-build of infrastructure in multiple basins; and the impact of recent governmentmandated curtailment of Canadian oil production. Taking these considerations into account on our
February earnings call we furnished 2019 full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance of +/- 2.75 billion
which reflects growth in our fee-based segments of approximately 180 million over 2018.
We continue to progress our organic growth capital plans and pursue opportunities to optimize
the utilization of our assets. We have set forth a Permian-focused organic growth capital program
of approximately 1.1 billion for 2019 and are working to add additional high-return strategic
opportunities as the year progresses. Importantly we enter 2019 with a much-improved balance sheet
improved financial flexibility and expect to generate significant cash flow in excess of distributions.
2
This positions us to fund the equity portion of our current capital program without needing to access
the equity capital markets while enabling us to consider an increase in our distribution level as soon
as the first quarter 2019 distribution payable in May 2019 and to further improve our financial
position over time.
Our goals for 2019 include:
1.	 Run a safe reliable and responsible operation

2018 Performance
2018 was an important year for our enterprise as
we posted good results and continued to transform
for the future. We delivered broad-based organic
growth of more than 3 percent with growth across
all business groups and geographic areas. Our team
expanded GAAP earnings-per-share by 12 percent to
8.89 or 10.46 on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow
conversion was 91 percent and we generated a strong
return on invested capital of more than 22 percent.
Premium margins remain a hallmark of 3M and in
2018 we delivered adjusted margins of 25 percent.
We also posted record sales of 33 billion while
returning 8.1 billion to shareholders through dividends
and share repurchases. Last year marked 60 straight
years of dividend increases for 3M shareholders
and we have already announced a 6 percent
increase to our first-quarter dividend in 2019.
Beyond financial results in 2018 we continued
to position 3M for long-term growth and value
creation. This includes good progress on each
of our four priorities – Portfolio Transformation
Innovation and People & Culture – which I laid
out at our Investor Day in November 2018.
Our first priority is Portfolio. The ongoing review and
reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing
value for our customers and shareholders. We’ve
taken significant actions over the last several years
including realigning from 40 businesses to 23 and
completing both acquisitions and divestitures. Yet
there is more we must do to stay relevant to the fastmoving needs of our customers and the marketplace.
In 2018 for example we sold our communication
markets business building on the successful portfolio
work we have done in recent years within Electronics
and Energy. We also announced the acquisition of
M*Modal’s technology business which is a leading
provider of healthcare solutions powered by artificial
intelligence. This acquisition – which was finalized
in February of 2019 – will expand our ability to
improve outcomes for both patients and providers.
Our second priority – Transformation – is fundamentally
improving how we serve our customers how we work
and how we compete. The backbone of Transformation
is a new ERP system and 2018 was an important year
in this journey. Our team successfully rolled out the ERP
system across all five business groups in the United
States which accounts for nearly 40 percent of our
global sales. To date we have deployed approximately
70 percent of our revenue on the new system and
we’re now stepping up efforts to fully leverage this
progress and accelerate value realization for customers
and 3M. Ultimately Transformation is making us a more
agile more efficient and more competitive enterprise.
The third priority is Innovation. Innovation is fundamental
to our organic growth and key to our long track
record of delivering premium margins and return on
invested capital. It allows us to create differentiated
solutions for our customers and superior returns for
our shareholders. For 3M innovation is embedded
in our culture and constantly fueled by investments
in both research and development and capital. In
2018 we invested 3.4 billion in the combination of
R&D and cap-ex with accelerated investments in
priority growth platforms focused around health care
transportation safety and infrastructure. Technology is
advancing rapidly in these market spaces and 3M will
continue to capitalize on the resulting opportunities.
People & Culture – our fourth priority – is foundational
to each of the other priorities. Everything that
differentiates 3M starts with our people. In 2018 we
expanded development opportunities for 3Mers
while deepening our commitment to diversity
inclusion and sustainability. We also earned a number
of external recognitions including being named one
of the world’s most ethical companies for the fifth
straight year and being included on the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the 19th consecutive year.

The 3M Value Model
Our four priorities are just one element of the 3M Value Model which demonstrates how we deliver for all
stakeholders: customers shareholders employees communities and business partners. I also presented this
at our November Investor Day and I would like to share with you as well.
Vision
Our vision drives everything we do:
It is authentic to 3M and aspirational and is an important part of our purpose as an enterprise.
Strengths
Our strengths help us continually innovate to create differentiated value. In our Customer-inspired Innovation
approach we combine close engagement with customers deep domain expertise in markets and our technology
platforms to develop unique insights – which often include unarticulated needs of our customers.
We then leverage our four fundamental strengths. In technology we apply our 46 platforms and deep intellectual
property across our businesses. One-third of our technology platforms sit in manufacturing which enables us to
deliver higher quality and better performing products. 3M’s global reach then allows us to use those technology
and manufacturing strengths to serve markets around the world where we have operations in over 70 countries
and sales in nearly all countries. Finally our brand adds value in each of our businesses.
3M does this while maintaining a focus on our customers – the end users of our solutions. Most of our sales are
specified or designed into customer applications. While the channel to our end user may change over time our
global commerce strategy is to connect directly to end users while leveraging the go-to-market model that will
deliver where when and how the end user chooses.

Priorities
Our four priorities – Portfolio Transformation Innovation and People & Culture – are positioning 3M for
long-term growth and value creation.
Values
Our values bind us together as one 3M – across business groups functions and geographies. They include our
leadership behaviors which lay out what we expect of our leaders to drive performance develop others and
win in the marketplace. Then our Code of Conduct: we’ve earned our reputation for integrity and the trust of our
stakeholders over many decades and no one at 3M is free to compromise it.
We also are working to make 3M the most inclusive enterprise we can be helping us become an even more
diverse creative and innovative company. Sustainability is an important value for us; it’s a key element of how we
apply science to life and going forward we will be an even more visible leader and innovator in this area. Finally
we will do even more to encourage and challenge every 3M employee to be their best.

New Five-Year Plan
Also during 3M’s Investor Day I outlined new five-year
financial objectives covering 2019 through 2023:
• 8–11 percent growth in earnings per share;
• 3–5 percent organic sales growth;
• 20 percent return on invested capital; and
• 100 percent free cash flow conversion.
These targets are realistic but aggressive
and reflect our confidence in the future of 3M.
Summary
It is a true honor to serve as CEO of our incredible
enterprise. I would like to take this opportunity to
recognize and thank Inge Thulin whose leadership took
3M to new levels of performance. I especially thank
Inge for his leadership and mentorship throughout
my career including over the last year as we worked
closely together in his role as executive chairman.
Looking ahead to the future we know we are
facing a world that will continue to change rapidly.
We remain focused on executing our plans
capitalizing on opportunities to drive stronger
growth and creating even greater value for our
customers and for you our shareholders.
Thank you for your confidence in 3M.

96,AbbVie,32753,110,28216,29000,Richard A. Gonzalez,Chairman &  Chief Executive Officer,Health Care,Pharmaceuticals,6,North Chicago,IL,42.325578,-87.8411818,"Dear AbbVie Shareholder
Our sixth year as AbbVie was filled with many successes and launched the next phase of our company’s evolution.
Since our outset in 2013 AbbVie has been dedicated to driving a remarkable impact on patients and society by
addressing some of the world’s most complex medical challenges. We have made substantial progress on this vision
while simultaneously delivering consistent top-tier performance and in 2018 posted our fourth consecutive year of
double-digit growth.
Performance in 2018 was our strongest to-date across several metrics. Operational revenue grew 15 percent to
32.7 billion with nearly one quarter of our global sales generated from products launched since our inception in
2013. Together with Humira these new products continue to advance the standard of care for patients and drove
sustained long-term growth.
On the strength of our business performance and amid continued healthy investment for the future we raised
our earnings forecast more than 20 percent over the course of 2018. We delivered adjusted earnings per share growth
of 41 percent to 7.91 the highest level of growth in our peer group and the best performance in AbbVie’s history.
We have demonstrated our strong commitment to our shareholders with quarterly dividend growth of 50 percent in
2018 and total growth of 168 percent since inception. We remain committed to investing in our business to sustain
long-term growth and rewarding our shareholders with a strong return on capital.
We continue to invest in our key therapeutic areas of Immunology Oncology and Neuroscience as we strive to
bring innovative new treatments to patients. Since our inception we have launched more than 15 new therapies or
indications across our key therapeutic areas. Over the coming months we will see continued advancement of our midand late-stage pipeline as additional data from our clinical programs becomes available. As is true in our industry
bringing innovative new medicines that solve some of the most critical health conditions is a challenging and risky
goal. However when we are successful we achieve our mission of changing people’s lives. Unfortunately in 2018 we
also received disappointing results from the clinical program for Rova-T in small cell lung cancer one of the
hardest-to-treat forms of cancer. Our research continues to focus on the most serious conditions with significant unmet
medical need and although not all research endeavors will ultimately be successful we remain relentless in our pursuit
of leading-edge science to provide new hope to patients around the world.
As expected in 2018 the launch of biosimilar competition for Humira began in many areas around the world. We
remain confident in our robust product portfolio and promising late-stage pipeline to continue to deliver growth. For
example in 2018 we launched Orilissa the first new treatment for women suffering from endometriosis in more than
a decade. In 2019 we expect to receive regulatory approval for two new Immunology therapies risankizumab and
upadacitinib that have demonstrated superior efficacy in clinical studies and have the potential for market leadership.
We remain focused on augmenting our pipeline through internal and external innovation to generate a steady cadence
of new product launches well into the next decade.
At AbbVie we live a culture of giving back. That’s why in 2018 we pledged an additional 350 million to support
U.S. nonprofits creating long-term impact in communities in need from North Chicago to Puerto Rico and other cities
across America. We focused our contributions in three areas that align with our philanthropic priorities—helping
families thrive disaster relief and strengthening K-12 education—demonstrating the very best of AbbVie and our
culture.
AbbVie employees around the world are passionate and dedicated to driving a remarkable impact for patients
through life-changing therapies. We are entering an exciting phase of AbbVie’s journey one that will set the foundation
for sustainable success and we thank you for your continued support of our company.
Sincerely
Richard A. Gonzalez

have seen many ups and downs. The cyclical nature
of our agricultural and energy businesses has trained
us to prepare for good times and difficult times. And
we have become incredibly skilled at managing those
highs and lows in every part of the supply chain from
the farm field to the consumer’s table.
But we wouldn’t be able to succeed or even survive
those cycles without focus — focus on the big picture
and on our long-term goal: serving those who produce
food for the world.
Fiscal 2018 was a challenging year on many levels
but we remained focused on our priorities. That
single-minded focus helped us complete the year
with significant results in many of our energy grains
and foods businesses. We’re proud of what we were
able to accomplish as a system and as a company
despite demanding market conditions.
One year ago we described our fiscal 2018 priorities
which were to strengthen relationships with owners
and employees sharpen our operational excellence
and restore financial flexibility. Through the hard work
of leaders and employees of CHS our goals within
those priorities have been met and exceeded. And they
have laid the foundation for our 2019 priorities:
• Enhance the owner experience through deeper
relationships seamless interactions with CHS at
every level and more effective technology solutions
• Equip our employees by enhancing their expertise
preparing them to serve CHS owners amid change
and encouraging new perspectives
• Drive enterprise business growth by focusing on our
core businesses continuing to improve efficiency
and increasing market share
The bottom line is a focus on our owners’ needs and
on doing what we do well — but doing it even better.
There is no shortage of companies striving to provide
inputs and marketing services for American farmers.
And as razor-thin margins continue to put pressure on
farm income and force increasingly difficult decisions
on farms and at local cooperatives we know we will
need to earn our owners’ business every day.
From left Debertin and Schurr
We take that task seriously. We understand it will
require better access to data stronger connections
between businesses more effective understanding
of owner needs and a streamlined approach to doing
business with our complex system.
And becoming the first choice for our owners and
customers in every core business will require continuing
to build deep relationships that benefit everyone. That
focus on collaboration and mutually beneficial results is
what cooperatives do best. Our success depends on the
success of our owners.
We are committed to delivering value to our owners —
local cooperatives and producers — at every step. That
value will come through providing creative solutions
and local expertise making global connections and
identifying practical approaches that give owners the
advantages they need to reach their goals. We are
focused on their success.

Shareholders and Friends
It’s an extraordinary time to be at Capital One.
In 2018 we advanced our quest to build an
enduringly great franchise with the scale brand
capabilities and talent to succeed in a world being
revolutionized by technology and data. Capital One
delivered record revenues and profits even as
we continued our investments in a bold strategic
agenda. We welcomed millions of new customers
and announced an exciting partnership with
Walmart. Thousands of talented and diverse
professionals from interns to executives joined
Capital One and we are consistently cited as
one of the best places to work in America. We
accelerated our progress on our transformational
journey and we are now one of the most cloudcapable companies in the world.
Our financial results in 2018 were rooted in years
of previous choices about growth investments and
risk management. Those choices often resulted in
near-term costs but they also planted the seeds
of future growth and financial returns. In 2018
the seeds of our investments bore fruit. Capital One
delivered strong growth in earnings and returns.
We posted record revenue of 28.1 billion and
record earnings per share (EPS) of 11.82. EPS net
of adjustments was 10.88 up 41% from 2017.*
Our return on average tangible common equity
was 18.6% up from 6.2% in 2017 or 12.0% as
adjusted for the impact of the U.S. tax reform of
1.77 billion. Our tangible book value per share
increased 14.8% to 69.20.
Financial markets however had a challenging year in
2018. All major stock bond and commodity indexes
declined. It was worse for bank stocks. The KBW
Bank Index declined 19.6% in 2018 and fell by 15.5%
in December alone its worst month since February
2009. Consumer lenders were hit even harder.
Our one-year total shareholder return (TSR) which
includes the combined effect of share price change
plus common dividends was negative 22.8% modestly
lower than the KBW Bank Index TSR of negative 17.7%.
From our IPO in 1994 to the end of 2018 an investment
in Capital One has delivered a TSR of 1700%.
We remain focused on building a company that
can generate and sustain solid growth in EPS and
tangible book value per share as well as strong
returns on tangible common equity. We believe
our investments in products technology brand
and resilience will drive growth improved efficiency
increased earnings power and strong capital
generation over time. Last year was the latest
chapter in an exciting journey.
An Improbable Story
This year we will celebrate our 25th anniversary as
a public company. We were founded on the belief
that the banking industry would be revolutionized
by information and technology beginning with
credit cards. Back then credit cards were a onesize-fits-all business that relied on judgmental
decision-making by underwriters and marketers.
There were few data-driven decisions and a whole
lot of conventional wisdom. But we saw credit cards
as an information-based technology business rather
than a lending business one powered by worldclass analysts leveraging the latest technology
massive amounts of information statistical
modeling and the scientific testing of thousands
of ideas. We set out to turn one-size-fits-all into
“mass customization” delivering the right product
to the right customer at the right time and at the
right price. We believed that by de-averaging the
market we could smash the price of credit and
also democratize it.
Our vision wasn’t just about credit cards. We
thought that credit cards would be the first banking
product to be transformed because they were
direct-marketed national in scope and there
was great financial leverage in getting marketing
and credit risk decisions right. We believed that if we
created a company with these capabilities we would
be positioned at the forefront of the digital
revolution that would ultimately sweep across all of
the banking industry. Our rallying cry was “Build a
technology company that does banking and compete
against banks that use technology.”
Capital One Was
the Original “FinTech”
It didn’t come easy at first. We had more passion
than customers and more belief than believers.
The term didn’t exist yet but in the early days of
Capital One we were a FinTech. For a while it was
unclear if our little company would get a chance to
make a big impact. We were a start-up: recruiting
talent building modern technology from scratch
conducting tests and incubating results. And all
along the way we worked to keep the dream alive.
While the initial idea came quickly it took five lonely
years until we had our first success. Against all
odds it finally worked and we haven’t looked back.
We built one of the nation’s largest credit card
businesses and then did the same thing in auto
finance and small business cards. We expanded to
the United Kingdom and Canada. A decade after
our IPO we decided to take on the part of banking
that will be the last to evolve retail banking. We are
now the nation’s fifth-largest consumer bank and
eighth-largest bank overall.
We’re Building a Technology
Company that Does Banking
As the world healed from the wounds of the Great
Recession technology continued its march into every
corner of our lives. Entire industries disappeared and
some of America’s greatest brands fell victim to the
digital revolution. New industries were born and their
leaders are now the most valuable companies in the
world. But the digital revolution didn’t just create new
industries. Advances in technology were having a
profound effect on all businesses and the banking
industry was no exception. As the digital revolution
accelerated we cheered. Because Capital One was
built to capitalize on the changing industry structure.
That’s who we are.
In 2012 as Capital One rounded the corner of
the economic crisis and absorbed two large and
successful acquisitions we took stock of the
accelerating change that was happening all around us.
3

And again we took an outsider’s view. To see the
future of banking we didn’t look at how banking
worked or what other banks were doing. We looked
instead at how technology was changing our lives.
We reveled in the miracle that Google could find
any information anywhere in the world in a fraction
of a second. We saw how Waze could instantly find
the fastest route and immediately adapt it if traffic
changed. And we marveled at how Netflix could
somehow find a movie you love even though you
had never heard of it and weren’t looking for it in the
first place. These remarkable capabilities share the
same DNA and are indicative of the destination for all
customer experiences: real-time and intelligent. In the
consumer’s language they bring instant solutions
customized for you wherever and whenever you want
them. Banking is an inherently digital product and its
destination will inexorably be the same. Consumers
will demand instant solutions customized to them.
That is where winning is.
But banks aren’t built to deliver real-time and
intelligent solutions. In fact they are built for just
the opposite. They are built on legacy technology
optimized for batch processing. They employ
complex manual processes that operate in
organizational silos. And many have corporate
cultures that are resistant to change. Even
Capital One which two decades before had been
designed around technology and information was
not designed for a world that was rapidly moving
to real-time and intelligent solutions. And so
years ago as we internalized the acceleration
of technology into every corner of our society two
truths became clear. First the digital revolution
would change everything in banking. And second
to capitalize on it we would need to rebuild our
bank from the bottom of the tech stack up. Despite
our having done that very thing twenty years
before the world had moved so much that we—
and pretty much all of corporate America—had
been stranded with insufficient tech talent and
antiquated foundational technology data
ecosystems and methods of working. The
common approach in corporate America is to work
forward from where you are rather than backward
from what technology enables. That leads to simply
digitizing analog activities or building customerfacing apps on top of outdated infrastructure.
Companies are bolting new technology capabilities
onto legacy operations or trying to quarantine
their modern technology and innovation to select
pockets of the organization. But to win we know
that we need to rethink how banking works and
build a technology company that does banking.
Strikingly our rallying cry today is the same as it
was in the beginning: “Build a technology company
that does banking and compete against banks that
use technology.”
And so we went all in. For years we have been
building a leading technology company that
can thrive in a world being revolutionized by
software and data. Today 85% of our technology
workforce are engineers. Capital One has embraced
advanced technology strategies and modern data
environments. We have adopted agile management
practices and not just for software delivery. Teams
across Capital One—even in places like Legal and
Audit—are deploying innovative approaches to get
work done and drive results. We employ a DevOps
culture with a “You Built It You Own It” mindset.
We harness highly flexible APIs and use microservices
to deliver and deploy software. We’ve been building
APIs for years and today we have thousands that
serve as the backbone for billions of customer
transactions every year. The vast majority of our
operating and customer-facing applications operate
in the cloud which unleashes our associates to

In the late 1990s we saw that auto lending was
ripe for transformation. It was an information-rich
business where success was driven by predicting
consumers’ creditworthiness and the likely value
of their cars in the future. But the industry was
based on judgmental decision-making and rules
of thumb and we realized that leveraging our
information-based strategy would allow Capital One
to minimize credit losses and thereby provide better
deals for consumers and better solutions for auto
dealers. We made our first auto loan in 1998 and
twenty years later we are one of the largest auto
lenders in America. We serve dealers and consumers
across the country and are investing in technology
to enhance the customer experience for both
groups. The technology transformation of the
industry will only accelerate from here. Consumers
now go online to research cars and shop for the
best price. But until recently they couldn’t find out
what the financing would be—based on their own
financial circumstances. Now Auto Navigator
®
 from
Capital One
®
 allows consumers to search millions of
cars at dealers across the country and instantly get
pre-qualified for financing customized to them.
Online or on your phone Auto Navigator gives car
buyers the knowledge and confidence to find the
car they want and know exactly what they’re paying
before they ever step foot on a dealer’s lot.
For decades commercial banking worked the same
way: loan underwriting was manual and subjective
and banks served local needs with generalist
bankers. But commercial banking is being
transformed by technology and an industry
once built on local generalists is moving to one
based on national specialists who deeply
understand the business and risks of their clients.
We’re building a commercial bank for the future
with scale and specialized capabilities in areas
like healthcare lending REITs and multifamily
real estate. Specialized expertise and technology
are helping Capital One manage risk and unlock
growth opportunities. We’re grateful to the
thousands of businesses across the country that
depend on our teams and our capital to help them

Our Businesses Are
Well-Positioned to Thrive
At Capital One we started our journey 100 years later
than most banks. In order to succeed we didn’t
try doing what other banks do. We carefully chose
which banking businesses to be in and focused
on building scale positions where scale mattered
most. For each of our businesses we tried to
identify the winning model of the future and then tried
to build that. In 2018 our lines of business delivered
resilient growth and strong profitability and they
are well-positioned to thrive in the years ahead.
Our credit card business is powered by data and
analytics and a passion to help people use credit
wisely. We serve tens of millions of customers
across the credit spectrum. We continue to invest
heavily in rewards products marketing programs
and digital experiences to attract and serve heavy
spenders. In 2018 our card business delivered
record returns resilient growth and continued
operating efficiency gains. In July we announced
a long-term agreement to be the exclusive issuer
of co-branded and private-label credit cards for
Walmart the world’s largest retailer. And in January
2019 we announced an agreement to acquire
approximately 9 billion of existing Walmart credit
card loans at a favorable price and terms. We’re eager
to work with Walmart to deliver amazing value
deepen customer relationships and use technology
and digital innovation to create exceptional
experiences for customers across America.
One of the last parts of banking to be transformed
will be local banking and deposits. On the shoulders
of our technology transformation we are building the

The Capital One story is built upon millions of little

a job to join a bank (of all things!) after graduation.
And a small business owner using his Spark rewards

helped transform cities and communities by
attracting incredibly talented associates with the
audacity to think they can change the world and
the humility to understand they need a whole lot
of help to make it happen. We’ve seen enormous
change in our culture and our society but the
change that took place over Capital One’s first
25 years will pale in comparison to the quarter
century that’s about to unfold. And we are wellpositioned to thrive as technology changes
everything. I am inspired by our customers who trust
us to serve them each day with both wisdom and

to lead 50000 associates who are all-in to change
banking for good.

we broke were set internally. The spirit of Progressive people is to set
audacious goals and we find that doing so intensifies our collaboration and
strengthens our relationships as a collective team. That may sound
pedestrian but it is fundamental to our identity and allows us to consider
the enterprise in its entirety and not as siloed functional areas. This
 isn’t something that we can visibly quantify but it has worked for over
80 years and we believe it allows us to balance our achievements with
a strong sense of togetherness with our Core Values as the backdrop.
To that end in 2018 we achieved the following:
– We moved up one position to become the #3 company in the private
passenger auto market. As we’ve stated time and time again this
gets us one step closer to achieving our ultimate vision.
– We crossed the 30 billion net premiums written (NPW) threshold after celebrating 20 billion in NPW only a few years earlier.
– We surpassed 20 million total policies in force (PIF) and 13 million
auto PIFs allowing us to be in more homes where we can continue
to grow especially with the Robinsons (customers with auto +
home). That rate of growth is incredible and could not have been
achieved had we all not been in sync on hiring and training well
in advance of need in order to service these new customers.
– We have continued to mount a full court press on retention and
now serve over 2 million customers who have been with us for a
decade or longer. We do not take this for granted and are acutely
aware that we need to earn their business each and every day.
LETTER
TO SHAREHOLDERS

– We now serve over a million Robinsons and see so much
more opportunity to grow in this consumer segment. Having
started at Progressive over 31 years ago it’s a thrill to see
how we have evolved from our nonstandard roots and are able
to serve every demographic.
– We concluded a multi-year investment in a new policy processing
system which now manages all auto and special lines policies.
IN A NUTSHELL
We wrapped up the year with a combined ratio (CR) of 90.6
and NPW growth of 20%. The results are extraordinary and
especially solid coming off of two very successful prior years
of profitable growth. We added over 5 billion in NPW in 2018
after adding 3.8 billion in 2017 and 2.8 billion in 2016.
Our Personal Lines CR was 90.3 with NPW growth of 18% and
auto PIF growth of 14%. Both the Agency and Direct channels
contributed to these stellar results. Our special lines products
PIF growth was relatively flat year-over-year reflecting our
already significant share of this market specifically with our
motorcycle and boat products.
A significant contributor to our results came from our
Commercial Lines area. We ended 2018 with a CR of 86.7 and
nearly 30% NPW growth and PIF growth just shy of 8%.
While growth was also strong in Property with NPW and PIF
growth of 33% and 32% respectively our profit results were
vastly affected by weather and natural catastrophes. Our catastrophe reinsurance program limited our retained losses and
loss adjustment expenses from Hurricane Michael to 60 million.
Unfortunately our retained catastrophe losses and loss adjustment expenses from hurricanes hail winter storms and the
California wildfires totaled 295 million accounting for 23 points
of our Property combined ratio of 106.9. We continue to take
rate to get us in line with our profitability target but this will
take time to earn in since Property policies have annual terms.

9
In addition to rate we are using underwriting rules and
coverage restrictions to manage our portfolio in high risk areas.
We remain confident that we will course correct that is if the
elements cooperate.
On the investment side we produced a 2018 total return of 1.2%.
The year was characterized by a return of volatility to the
financial markets after a relatively placid period in the previous
12 months. Our fixed-income portfolio was able to earn 1.5%
as our relatively shorter interest rate exposure and conservative
asset allocation allowed us to earn a positive return in a period
of rising rates. Following several years of strong returns
our equity portfolio returned -4.4% in 2018 as domestic equity
markets saw a steep drop in the fourth quarter.
The size of our investment portfolio has grown from 27 billion
at the beginning of the year to over 33 billion at the end of
2018. Even as financial markets may offer us more attractive
investment opportunities than a year ago our focus on
protecting the balance sheet has not changed. When adding
risk to our investment portfolio we will continue to pursue
investments that provide a favorable risk-return profile to
Progressive over the long term.
“Working with Progressive employees
from around the country to help our
customers recover from catastrophes
has been the most meaningful experience
of my time at Progressive.”
— C. Grube
We accessed the capital markets twice in 2018 in order to support
the company’s strong operating growth and for other general
corporate purposes. In March we issued 600 million of 4.20%
30-year senior notes and 500 million of 5.375% cumulative
perpetual preferred stock. We returned to the capital markets
in October to issue 550 million of 4.00% 10-year senior notes.
The combination of internally generated profits and these
external financings will both support our future growth and
allow us to maintain flexibility in our capital allocation decisions.
As in previous years we bought back enough Progressive
shares to neutralize dilution from equity-based compensation.
We continue to believe the most efficient use of our capital is
to reinvest it into our fast-growing operating business.
We ended 2018 with a Gainshare score of 1.91. This is the best
result since 2004 and the 7th year in a row that the score has
increased. We declared an annual dividend of 2.514 per common
share based on 2018 results and the formula that we communicated publicly. As previously announced and effective in 2019
we have revised our dividend policy (details discussed later).
10
As we head into 2019 we will continue to focus on policy or unit
growth as we often refer to it while pursuing our goal of earning
at least four cents of underwriting profit. We will watch trends
closely to stay ahead of them and not shock our customers with rate
increases. Meanwhile our investment team will continue to focus
on their goal of protecting the balance sheet and supporting the
growth of the operating side of Progressive.
LOOKING TO THE HORIZONS
You may recall that in the August 2017 Investor Relations
Webcast we outlined the three Horizons construct. We believe
that investing concurrently in the near- mid- and long-term
future of Progressive will ensure that we create and sustain an
enduring business. Our stance is that when we are executing
on the core business so well it is exactly the time to devote time
energy and dollars to advancing our future business opportunities. We internally refer to this as an “always growing” mindset.
HORIZON ONE (EXECUTE): This has been our focus since the
company was founded in 1937 and in more recent years we have
been more surgically focused on growth and gaining a larger
share of both the auto and home markets as well as creating
more Robinsons. This focus has clearly paid off and we believe
there is much more room for growth so this will continue to
be an area of concentration.
HORIZON TWO (EXPAND): In this horizon we are focusing on
adjacencies —building upon our existing capabilities and market
position to offer more products and services to our current and
potential customers. We have made large investments in developing
a business owners policy product which we expect to launch
this year as well as offering other coverages for small businesses
that desire to shop directly with Progressive. We’ve made people
systems and brand investments and see this as an area where
we can excel and profitably grow. In another sector we continue
to deepen our relationship with Uber and have gone from 1 state
in 2016 to 4 in 2018 and expect to expand to 13 states in total in
early 2019.
HORIZON THREE (EXPLORE): As I communicated in last year’s letter
to shareholders in December of 2017 we formed an internal
eleven-person part-time Strategy Council to take some time to
understand future trends and market shaping forces. The team
focused on opportunities where we can use our skills to define
ideas for future business initiatives and invest in areas where we
believe we can win. In July of 2018 we named Andrew Quigg
our Chief Strategy Officer. He has created a new full-time strategy
team that will concentrate on designing products that solve
unmet consumer needs. We are excited to explore test and invest
in this horizon to achieve our goal of always growing. 
MANAGING CAPITAL FOR THE FUTURE
We take great pride in our transparency around communicating
significant changes. Although we provided some detailed Q&A with
our November earnings release I would like to expand upon our
capital management philosophy and how we plan to use that capital.
At Progressive effective capital management is an important
component of our financial brand. When considering how to
deploy capital we have consistently said that we will look first to
invest to support the growth of the current and future earnings
power of Progressive. If we have capital beyond what is needed
to fund growth and innovation that is when we have “underleveraged capital” we will return it to shareholders. We have
historically used three tools to send underleveraged capital back
to our shareholders: an annual dividend share repurchases
and special dividends. We believe this approach is a strong
indicator of our thoughtful stewardship of capital.
Many years ago we articulated a formula for calculating our
annual variable dividend which considered the business
and investment results. At that time we had moderate growth
expectations and attractive investment returns and routinely
generated more capital than we needed. Our formulaic variable
dividend and special dividends when warranted served us
very well returning on average about 50% of comprehensive
income annually. Since the inception of the variable dividend
program we produced an annual return on shareholders’ equity
of 17% and grew our book value just over 100% which is among
the best in the industry even after the significant amount of cash
we returned to shareholders over that same time. We are very
proud of these results.
More recently we have been experiencing faster growth in a very
low-return investment environment creating a need for more
capital to underpin growth. While our business does not consume
massive capital for property plant or equipment the regulatory
construct and need for contingent capital due to weather and
other unforeseen circumstances requires significant capital
reserves. Given our strong growth and outlook we decided that
it was a good time to take a step back and reassess our dividend
policy especially given the fact that our business model is
evolving as we think about our long-term growth potential. We
are committed to investing our capital when we have compelling
opportunities to do so and to being flexible and nimble to drive
shareholder value and to attract a broad and diverse set of
shareholders. Given the current business environment our
opportunities to grow and our commitment to shareholder value
we decided to alter our approach to our annual dividend.
It is difficult to forecast the amount of capital that we will need
to invest to pursue the opportunities that will be developed in
all three Horizons and therefore we believe that a flexible dividend
policy is appropriate for Progressive. At the same time we recognize that many of our shareholders and prospective shareholders
value a predictable cash return from their investments. Therefore 
“When we volunteer as a team in the
community this is when I feel closest to
my teammates because we’re working
together to benefit others and learning
more about each other at the same time.”
 — W. Shippy
we adopted a new dividend policy that will pay a regular quarterly
dividend which we expect to be 0.10 per common share through
2019 with the potential for an annual variable dividend at year end.
The variable component of the dividend will reflect the performance
of the business and the growth and investment opportunities we
see and will be determined by the Board of Directors. While the
old dividend formula was affected by the company’s Gainshare factor
the new approach will not be so influenced. We found that the
Gainshare factor reflects performance and does not capture growth
and investment opportunities which had the potential to increase
dividend payouts when it could be advantageous to retain the capital
in the business to support growth. While less formulaic than our
previous variable dividend approach the new variable dividend
will avoid the binary nature of the current dividend’s payout based
on the restriction of comprehensive income necessarily exceeding
after-tax underwriting income.
We have been pleased with how our variable dividend has complemented our overall capital strategy for the past decade and are
equally excited about the modified dividend policy and the flexibility
it affords us to pursue sustained growth for the benefit of shareholders.
We remain committed to investing our assets to grow our business
and maximize value and when our growth does not require all of
the capital we have available to returning underleveraged capital
to shareholders.

OUR FOUR CORNERSTONES
On many occasions we’ve shared the construct we use to
think about having a competitive advantage and we fittingly
named it our four cornerstones. The first three make up the
foundation and reflect who we are (Core Values) why we’re
here (Our Purpose) and where we’re headed (Our Vision).
The last and where I will provide a few highlights of several of
the investments we’ve made we refer to as our four Strategic
Pillars (how we’ll get there).
Pillar 1: Progressive people and our culture are
collectively our most powerful source of competitive
advantage.
Sufficiently describing our unique and special culture continues
to elude me. Maybe it’s the pride of knowing that we are making
a difference in each other’s lives and doing our best to be there
for our customers when they need us the most. It might be the
small subtle gestures that are witnessed so frequently that it
would take a novel to share every kind action that takes place
within and outside our walls. What we do know is that the basis
of our distinct culture starts with our Core Values and we follow
them diligently in order to get great results in the right way.
I often comment about there not being a spreadsheet that I can
reference to prove how incredible our culture is (and you know
we like our spreadsheets). That said we did receive countless
recognitions from outside sources. I won’t name them all but
they came in the form of accolades like best company to work
for best workplace for diversity best workplace for women
parents veterans and millennials. Lists don’t define us and we
wouldn’t change what we do just to be put on those lists. We do
strongly believe that if you treat people like they want to be
treated and create a workplace where you can feel comfortable
bringing your whole self to work you tend to get noticed.
Pillar 2: Meeting the broader needs of our customers
throughout their lifetime.
We continued heavy investment in our digital customer service
products in 2018. We recognize that when someone decides to
start a relationship with Progressive we must support that
relationship with world-class experiences and treatment in all
areas especially digital. This includes a focus and investment on
a smart simple and satisfying digital offering that meets our
customers’ needs wherever whenever and however they choose.
As such we continued a large commitment to revamp our
self-service website experience in conjunction with extending
our mobile app offering. This undertaking included not just
a new web interface look and set of features but also a new
technology stack. With these investments going forward we’ll
be better positioned to continue advancing in innovative ways
across all digital touchpoints in a way that builds stronger and
longer relationships with our customers.
We also leveraged new technologies to meet the evolving expectations of customers and to drive additional expense reduction.
Of note here we launched our virtual assistant in our mobile app
in November. Leveraging the star of our Superstore marketing
campaign we dubbed this virtual assistant “Ask Flo.” It allows
customers to get instant support by interacting with an automated
bot in a chat-like interface— with the heart and personality of
our brand as personified by “Flo.”

We understand that price is critical to insurance consumers
so we need to do all we can to lower costs to enable competitive
prices. Of course this can’t be at the expense of a positive
customer experience. With this in mind we’ve been able to
find solutions that properly balance lower costs and a great
customer experience.
We’re also heavily experimenting and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI). One example of this is in a new chatbot application
where we use AI to interpret incoming chat requests and provide
automated responses based on the perceived intent of the
customer. In some cases the response provides answers to the
most commonly asked questions related to that topic and in
other cases it provides a phone number so that the customer can
contact the group best positioned to address their issue. The
model reduces the effort required to deliver straightforward
answers on simple issues.
Another example of our use of AI is a Progressive-built application we call Docuflash. It uses artificial intelligence to discern
document content to forward incoming documents without
human intervention. Docuflash leverages optical character
recognition (OCR) to “read” incoming documents classify them
appropriately and forward them to the appropriate group for
additional work as needed. Eliminating this more rudimentary
work generates expense savings and creates the opportunity for
our people to focus on the more complex tasks of acting on the
incoming documents.
To deliver our ideal customer experience we also believe it’s
critical to understand and recognize that different customers
have different needs and preferences. In order to personalize at
scale we have been working on a project to personalize the
renewal experience and give customers a compelling reason to
continue their relationship with Progressive. To that end we’re
standing up a technology platform that will enable us to test
personalized experiences deployed in a coordinated fashion
across all of our customer communication channels. Our vision
is to create truly customized journeys aligned with how each
customer prefers to interact with us.

“For me togetherness at Progressive
means enjoying the company of
my team at lunch. We share stories
laugh a lot and bond over what
we have in common and value what
we have that is different.”
— M. Falcone
We also introduced new technology into our voice experience
by replacing our legacy touch-tone interactive voice response
(IVR) system with one where our customers can speak naturally
when calling Progressive. Our new experience is easier and
allows more self-service options for customers to interact with
us without a Progressive consultant getting involved. We believe
these advancements allow us to meet customers’ needs by
providing a superior customer experience while giving us an
expense benefit.
Pillar 3: Maintaining a leading brand recognized for
innovative offerings and supported by experiences that
instill confidence.
We designed and released an all-new quoting experience for
and on behalf of our agents to make it easier to support quoting
bundled policies for our customers. Our For Agents Only
(FAO) Portfolio quoting (also referred to as Portfolio) is now
live for all agents appointed to write new business in three states
with plans for future state releases and expectations to share
Portfolio with agents countrywide by mid-2020.
Portfolio offers the following:
 – Less data entry: Portfolio reduces quote time by finding available
customer vehicle and property information. In addition
Portfolio auto-fills customer information across products so
agents can spend less time typing and more time forming
relationships with their customers.
 – The more (products) the merrier: Thanks to Portfolio FAO can
now support bundled quotes for the first time. When agents
start a quote from the FAO homepage Portfolio’s product
picker displays all available products allowing agents to select
multiple products right from the beginning. Supported products—
those that agents can quote and sell within Portfolio — include
auto special lines home condo and renters.
 – The power of choice: Rather than working directly through
an insurance company’s quoting system many agents use
comparative rater software to shop multiple companies for their
customers. Agents can easily add products to a rater quote
before completing the sale in Portfolio.
 – It all comes together: The namesake Portfolio page gives
agents and their customers an overview of premium bundle
savings and applied discounts. Agents can add or remove a
product with one click speeding up the sales process.
Our highly recognized brand grants us a venue to clearly
communicate our innovative offerings to our customers and
consumers alike. Few brands have sustained a single icon for
over a decade. Flo is one of the longest-running brand characters
appearing in over 150 ads that take place in our alternate-reality
“Superstore.” To keep our flagship show fresh this year we 
introduced Flo’s Squad her ever-expanding crew of colleagues
who represent our long-lasting commitment to providing impressive service and protection at an affordable price.
In addition to expanding our characters we also expanded
our messages in order to more firmly align them with the needs
of our customers. As an example in new ads like “Fluent in
Insurance” we promoted our online insurance jargon translator
Progressive Answers. We doubled the number of media
impressions focused on auto/home bundle messages in 2018
compared to 2015. And in partnership with national media
outlets including “The Today Show” we more widely publicized
our Keys to Progress® program which in recent years donated
on average 100 refurbished cars per year to veterans in need.
Creative was not the only area of optimization. We also delivered
some exciting portfolio shopping experiences including
Progressive HomeQuote Explorer® (HQX) and Progressive
BusinessQuote Explorer® (BQX) leading digital home and
business insurance marketplaces.
Pillar 4: Offering competitive prices driven by industryleading segmentation claims accuracy and operational
efficiency.
Our auto policies in force grew over 14%. As we shared with you
during our third quarter webcast our expanding ability to
segment has accelerated policy growth in recent periods. During
the time frame from 2013 to 2016 it took us 30 months to add a
million auto policies in force. The next million policies took us
15 months with the subsequent million taking only 8 months.
Most recently we added 1 million policies in force in a mere six
months. We attribute this to our large investments in our product
design focused on segmentation and risk selection (matching
rate to risk).

In addition we continue to evolve our usage-based insurance
segmentation. We introduced in 10 states a new algorithm that
adds distracted driving to the other already powerful variables
we track and we plan to roll it out more broadly in 2019.
Operational efficiency is a key component of our competitive
prices strategy pillar. At 20.4% our expense ratio is among the
lowest in our industry. A bit more than half of that ratio is
comprised of commissions paid to our agents and advertising
costs or what we refer to as acquisition costs. We view increasing these acquisition costs as generally requisite to growing
profitably. To grow and ensure the viability of the agency
distribution channel we pay competitive commissions and we
target aggregate commission at around 10.5% of agency premium.
We’ve grown advertising costs to over 1.4 billion in 2018 and
have done so optimizing incremental spend at the lowest level
possible. We did this not only in digital media but increasingly
in mass media and even down to cost per incremental sale metrics
at the television show and daypart level. We buy the majority of
our media in-house and analyze massive amounts of data often
in real-time to ensure very competitive advertising spend.
We also focus on non-acquisition costs as we believe lowering
these costs while still providing great service and a great work
environment allows us to grow faster. We invest in technology
to drive cost out of our processes while improving the customer
and agent experience and allowing for our people to focus on
higher value-added work. Policies in force per FTE (full-time
equivalent) and revenues per FTE are key metrics in driving
towards a lower cost structure and we’ve made great progress
on both of these. Our ultimate metric of underwriting cost
effectiveness is what we call our non-acquisition expense ratio
(NAER). For 2018 we reduced our Personal Lines NAER by 0.7
points to 9.1% and for our Commercial Lines business we
reduced NAER by 0.8 points to 11.0%. These improvements
allow us to continue to keep our rates competitive and meet or
exceed our profitability targets.
The costs to settle a claim or loss adjustment expense (LAE)
is balanced along with customer service work environment
and settling the claim accurately. We are extremely pleased that
our accuracy performance improved in a year with significant
growth in both claim counts and claim employees while lowering
the cost to settle our average auto special lines and commercial
lines claim features by over 2%. In concert with growing average
premium per policy this lower cost per claims feature allowed
us to lower our loss adjustment expense ratio by 0.7 points for
the year to 10.2%.

THAT’S A WRAP
As we put a bow on 2018 and reflect on the numerous
celebrations that took place over the year it reminded me of
something that Peter B. Lewis always said — make sure to
have fun. We all worked hard and together achieved a tremendous amount on the business front but along the way we
had a lot of fun which exemplifies the spirit of Progressive.
We are so thankful for our partners our agents and the
customers that motivate us to do better every day. You all have
our commitment that we will work hand in glove to excel as
we sprint into 2019.
I am especially grateful to the over 38 thousand Progressive
people that inspire me daily. The accomplishments that we
collectively achieved this year mean so much more when they
are attained with people you enjoy working with side-by-side.
Thanks for all that you do.

by double-digit volume growth of
Coca-Cola Zero Sugar along with
strong performance from new lowand no-calorie versions of sparkling
beverages such as Sprite and Fanta.
• Our innovations included Coca-Cola
Plus Coffee now available in
multiple markets around the world
and a restage for Diet Coke in
North America that included new
packaging marketing and flavors.
• We launched about 600 new
products. Of those more than 250
were low- or no-sugar and more
than 400 were juices teas waters
and other non-sparkling beverages. 
Lifting shifting and scaling
brands around the world:
• We used the strength of our
distribution system to help launch
brands like Fuze Tea smartwater
and AdeS across multiple markets
with increased speed and agility.
• Worldwide we expanded 165

Making strategic investments
for the future:
• We strengthened and expanded
our portfolio through mergers
and acquisitions including
Costa Limited which closed in
early 2019 and gives us a global
coffee platform.
• We invested in a strategic
partnership with the premium
sports hydration brand
BODYARMOR one of the fastestgrowing beverage trademarks in
the U.S.
Investing in the Coca-Cola system
advantage:
• We are aligned with our bottling
partners to capture growth
opportunities. Since 2010 we’ve
invested—with our system—more
than 125 billion to strengthen
our platform for growth including
technology such as connected
coolers; and in new plants and
route-to-market innovation.
• For example our bottling partner
Arca Continental the first Latin
American bottler to operate in the
U.S. announced a 250 million
investment in a new facility in Texas
to help us get more drinks to the
market faster.

The Coca-Cola Company 2018 Business & Sustainability Report 3
Building leadership for success
and a growth culture:
• We announced several key
leadership appointments including
Brian Smith as president and chief
operating officer John Murphy as
chief financial officer and new group
and business unit presidents.
• Our new Global Ventures group
led by Jennifer Mann was created
to ensure we connect and globally
scale key acquisitions investments
and brands such as Costa innocent
Dogadan and Monster.
• These changes will help us continue
to build a culture that fuels our
transformation and supports
growth worldwide.
Creating Shared Opportunity
through Growth
While we’re proud of our business
results in 2018 companies like ours
have a responsibility as leaders. As
we grow we will continue to support
local economies and help create
economic opportunity.
Our commitment to doing business the
right way continued in 2018 as we set
out to show the world that the drinks
they love can make life more enjoyable
without harming our planet and the
natural resources we all depend on.
In early 2018 we announced our World
Without Waste initiative with a clear
simple goal: to help collect and recycle
a bottle or can for each one we sell by
2030. The company’s progress during
the first year included:
• establishing or joining 10 global
recycling/packaging partnerships;
• announcing four packaging
technology advancements including
the opening of our PlantBottleTM IP
for use across the industry; and
• launching bottles made from
100% recycled materials in
multiple markets.
We replenished 155% of the water
we use in our finished beverages
to communities and nature in 2018
continuing to exceed our 2020 goal. We
also economically empowered more
than 865000 women in 2018 adding
an additional 17 countries.
We don’t just recognize our
responsibility to be a part of the
solution to challenges we all
face—we embrace it.
For us that means using our size
scale and success to create shared
opportunity through growth—creating
real opportunity for our communities
our customers our employees and
our shareowners.
Leveraging Data to Help Us Grow
Our Business the Right Way
Finally I am a firm believer in the
importance of data. In a digital and
data-driven world good information
helps us make better decisions.
When we share our data we can help
drive collective accountability for us
and others.
In this year’s report—our first combined
business and sustainability report—
we created a detailed Data Appendix
to share more details on our progress
and metrics. This is an idea born from
stakeholder engagement and our belief
that working together we can create a
positive impact and respond effectively
to the collective challenge of the
UN Sustainable Development Goals.
We are pleased with our progress
against some of our goals while
recognizing that more needs to be
done in other areas. We will continue to
take action and grow our business the
right way—not the easy way.
Sincerely
James Quincey
Chief Executive Officer
